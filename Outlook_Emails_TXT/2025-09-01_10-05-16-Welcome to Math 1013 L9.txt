Dear everyone,

Welcome to Math1013 L9 this fall! I’m Junbang Liu, and I’ll be your instructor. I’m really looking forward to getting to know all of you and working together this semester.

Our first class will be on:
• Date & Time: Monday, September 1, 15:00 - 16:20
• Place: Lecture Theater E

The website of the course is Canvas <https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/66058/pages/l9-junbang-liu> . I have uploaded the lecture notes of the first week there. Please check that you can access the site. I’ll also upload  worksheet whichs contain some questions for each lecture. Those are designed to help you practice and check your understanding of the material from class. Take it easy, they are not required homework. 

For the first class, you don’t need to prepare anything in advance — just come with curiosity and ready to learn. And in the first class, we’ll just review some topics from high school. 

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to drop me an email. I’m happy to help. 

See you in class soon!

Best(秋安),
Junbang Liu
Instructor, Math1013 L9
