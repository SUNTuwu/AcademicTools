Dear Undergraduate Students

 

The Fall Term 2025-26 will start on 1 September 2025 (next Monday).  Please check your updated class enrollment records with the SIS (Student Center).  Refer to 'My Class Schedule' for the wait-listing and enrolled classes in both list and weekly calendar views.  You may filter the Enrolled, Waitlisted and Dropped classes in the schedule.

 

Due to system routine maintenance and the release of reserved quotas, the Class Enrollment functions (add/drop/swap and the shopping cart) will be SUSPENDED from 11:59pm, 31 August (Sunday) to 9:30am, 1 September 2025 (Monday).  Students who wish to submit add/drop requests before the start of term are advised to complete their requests by 11:59pm, 31 August.  Checking of “My Class Schedule” will not be affected and is available throughout the term.

 

The last day of Add/Drop period of most undergraduate classes is 13 September 2025 (Saturday).  The add/drop/swap functions will close at 11:59pm on that day.  For the wait-listing classes, a place may be confirmed automatically any time during the add/drop period when vacancies arise.  Please check your class enrollment records frequently.  If you no longer want to enroll in the classes you are waiting, you must DROP the 'waiting' classes yourself.  Around 1:00am each day, email notifications will be sent to students whose waiting class has been confirmed on the previous day.

 

Please be reminded again that classes in your shopping cart are not yet confirmed.  You need to enroll the classes before the end of add/drop if you want to take the classes.

 

Let us know if you have any questions.  Please always quote your student number and full name in your e-mail enquiries.  Thank you.
