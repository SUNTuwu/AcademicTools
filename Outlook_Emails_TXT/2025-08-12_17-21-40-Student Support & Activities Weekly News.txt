*       Enable firewalls and antivirus software on your devices.

*       Never download or install anything while using public Wi-fi – wait until you get home.

*       Don’t input any personal information to register for public Wi-fi. If they ask for it, don’t use this network.

*       When you finish using the public Wi-fi, always log out from the network, and click “Forget this network” in your settings.

*       Choose your public Wi-fi wisely. Search online to check if it has been verified if you’re not sure.

*       Don’t shop online or do anything private until you switch to a secure connection.
