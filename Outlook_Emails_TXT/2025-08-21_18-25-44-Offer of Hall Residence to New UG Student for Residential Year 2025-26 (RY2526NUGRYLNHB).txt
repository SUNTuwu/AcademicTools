I.                   Eligibility

Hall offer becomes null and void once you cease to be a full-time registered student or become ineligible for student housing. It is your responsibility to inform the Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO) in writing INSTANTLY in case you are no longer eligible for student housing and vacate the student accommodation immediately. Please refer to Eligibility for Student Accommodation <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/admission-policy/ug/eligibility-for-student-accommodation>  for details.

 

 

II.                Hall and Room Allocation

Hall and Room Allocation are made by considering residents’ preferences (indicated in the hall applications), subject to availability. There is NO GUARANTEE of a particular assignment to any student hall, room type or with a specific roommate while Residence Masters have maintained that no change of hall will be accepted to promote a sense of belonging. Please refer to Can I choose my hall/room <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/apply-for-housing/ug/can-i-choose-my-hall-room-new-local-ugs-non-local-ugs-continuing-ugs>  for details about Hall and Room Allocations, and Official Hall/ Room Swapping.   

 

 

III.             Payment of Hall Charges

1.                  If you have accepted the offer, your hall fee instalment for the Fall Semester of the Residential Year 2025-26 will be posted to the Student Information System (SIS) after the acceptance period. Please settle the hall fees IN FULL by the payment due date.

 

2.                  Hall Charges for the Residential Year 2025-26 are calculated by referencing the rates set in Annual Hall Charges (for New Local students <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/apply-for-housing/ug/hall-charges-new-local#RY2526> ) and in pro-rata to the residential period for different room types.

 

3.                  Those with any financial difficulties and who require extra time to settle the payment may apply to the Scholarships and Financial Aid Office for deferment of the hall fee here <https://sfao.ust.hk/page.php?i=24>  after completing the registration and activating HKUST account.

 

4.                  You should keep the payment record (e.g. bank deposit slip, a screenshot of successful online transactions, etc.) as proof in case verification is needed; for example, when there is no payment record found in SIS. Paid hall fees are non-refundable and non-transferable.

 

5.                  If you decide NOT to stay in the hall for the stated residential period, do not check in, and send a written request to ughousing@ust.hk <mailto:ughousing@ust.hk>  for hall withdrawal on or before 4 September 2025. Otherwise, you will be held responsible for settling the hall fee in full regardless of your check-in status while penalties that affect your future hall application may arise.

 

 

IV.             Check-in Procedures

Check-in/out details are available here: Check-in/out Procedures <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/residential-halls/hall-life/check-in-out-procedures> .

 

If you are unable to check-in by the stated deadline, you must email your hall office <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/about/contact-us>  and ughousing@ust.hk <mailto:ughousing@ust.hk> , providing your reason and relevant proof to seek special approval. Failure to check-in within the assigned period with no justification and special approval will result in immediate CANCELLATION of Hall Offer without prior notice. Paid hall fees will NOT be refunded under such circumstances.

 

Meanwhile, a fixed penalty of HK$100 per person per night plus hall charges incurred on a daily basis will be levied on those who fail to check out by the given deadline.

 

 

V.                Important Rules and Penalties

Students must note that trading or private transfer of hall place is strictly forbidden. All discovery/reports of violation of rules will be investigated and penalties (e.g., recovery of the hall place offered, forfeiture of hall charges paid, disqualification of future hall application, further disciplinary action) will be levied on the student(s) involved.
