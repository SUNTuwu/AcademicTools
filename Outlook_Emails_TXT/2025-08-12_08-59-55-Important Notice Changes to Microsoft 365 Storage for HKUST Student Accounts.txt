Dear Student, 

We would like to inform you about the recent changes to your Microsoft student account storage, in line with the Global Microsoft 365 Education updates <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/microsoft-365-storage-options>  affecting universities worldwide. Under these changes, HKUST student Email Mailboxes will be adjusted to 15 GB, and the OneDrive quota will be adjusted to 50 GB.

 

Newly created HKUST student accounts in the current cohort will be assigning these new storage quotas. Existing students will be gradually transitioned to the new quotas by 31 October 2025.

 

Detailed updates to all HKUST Student Accounts <https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/general-it-services/user-account/student/student-account#Updates-Std-Account>  and suggested good practices: 

Email: 

*	The quota will be adjusted to 15GB.
*	Once your mailbox reaches 90% capacity, the Archive Mailbox <https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/general-it-services/communication-collaboration/email/exchange-online/archive-mailbox>  will be automatically activated in Outlook, and emails older than two years will be moved to this Archive Mailbox, freeing up space and not counting towards your storage quota.

 

Please note that your HKUST student email account serves as the University’s official communication channel. Please regularly delete unnecessary emails <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/mailbox-storage-limits-in-outlook-f170fe90-b859-4034-bcda-e186fc6a26f5>  and saving large attachments to other storage to ensure you continue to receive important emails from the University. 

 OneDrive:

*	The quota will be gradually adjusted to 50GB.

*	When OneDrive usage exceeds the quota, access will be restricted to read/download/delete functions only.

 

Please review your OneDrive and clean up unnecessary files <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/delete-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-21fe345a-e488-4fa7-932b-f053c1bebe8a>  to stay within the quota.
