Dear Students,

 

The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) is now accepting applications for Fall 2025-26. Schedule for UROP Fall 2025-26 can be found here <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/schedule> .

 

Course Types:

*   The Series Stream (UROP1100/2100/3100/4100) is a 1-credit course and a prerequisite of P* (Pass to Proceed) grade is required for students to continue the course series at a higher level under the same project, e.g., receiving P* in UROP1100 in order to enroll in UROP2100.

*   The 1-credit UROP3200 course (Undergraduate Research Opportunities with Mini-conference Experience) is now offered as a Common Core UxOP Course. For more details of UROP3200, please refer to the webpage HERE <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/urop3200_projects> . 

(Note: The on-campus Mini-conference for Fall 2025-26 is tentatively scheduled to be held in the afternoon of 1 December 2025 (Monday). Students should reserve your time for the event.)

 

Eligibility Requirements:

*   First-time UROP participant is required to have enrolled in a full-time degree-bearing program for at least two semesters at HKUST and attained a minimum CGA of 3.30 for UROP1100. For students who have completed UROP1000 before, this requirement can be waived.

*   UROP participants are expected to fulfil the CGA requirement of 3.0 (for UROP1000) or 3.3 (for UROP1100). To allow more students with research potentials to join UROP, effective from Summer 2023-24, supervisors are allowed to provide strong justification with substantial grounds to support applications from students who fail to meet the CGA requirements but demonstrate research competencies. Such justification should include:

*	Student’s achievement of related awards, contests and/or other activities 
*	Student’s previous research experience and/or research skills 
*	Student’s academic performance in related course(s) and/or coursework

Students should submit a study plan in which they specify how they will manage their projects throughout the semester. The UROP Office reserves the right of final decision on the eligibility of any students under exceptional consideration.

 

*   For UROP 3200, a prerequisite of TWO passing grades in TWO UROP1100 courses OR TWO passing grades in UROP1100 and UROP2100 is required. 

*   Students are advised to discuss with the project supervisors on how the project will be conducted.

*   For UROP students of Summer 2024-25 who wish to continue the UROP series (i.e., UROP2100/3100/4100) in Fall 2025-26: the UROP report and a P* (Pass to Proceed) grade must be received and checked by the UROP Office BEFORE you submit an online application.

 

Additional Course Completion Requirement:

*   Effective from Spring 2022-23, apart from the submission of a final report, all UROP students are required to complete an online training of “Responsible Conduct of Research” (RCR). The training aims to equip students with knowledge of good practices on conducting research. 

*   You are required to watch all the lecture videos and complete the quizzes of all 10 required and supplemental modules (if any, as project supervisors may require their students to complete supplemental modules based on their project nature), within one month after the end of the add/drop period, 13 October 2025 (Monday), at the latest.

*   Please submit the completion report to the UROP Office via email at urop@ust.hk <mailto:urop@ust.hk>  for checking by 20 October 2025 (Monday).

*   To complete the RCR training, students should complete the quiz (3-5 MC questions) at the end of each required (and supplemental) module and obtain at least 80% for each. Quizzes can be re-attempted as many times as needed until the requirement is met. Students who fail the RCR training course will receive a Fail grade in the UROP course. 

*   UROP students who have taken the training and obtained a Pass in each required module in previous semester do NOT need to do the training and submit the report again.

*   Please refer to the guidelines HERE <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/For_Students>  for more information on the training.
