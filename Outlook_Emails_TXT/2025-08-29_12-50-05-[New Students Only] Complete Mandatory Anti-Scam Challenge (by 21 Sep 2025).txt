[The following message is for all NEW students (UG & PG).]

 

 

Dear New Students,

 

Welcome to HKUST! We hope you had a restful summer break. 

 

We write to alert you of a mandatory requirement for all NEW students – the Anti-scam Challenge (ASCM1000). You must complete and “Pass” (50% correct) the challenge by 21 Sep 2025 for continued access to Library resources (all electronic resources and physical access) beyond 21 Sep 2025.

 

ASCM1000 will be accessible via Canvas <https://canvas.ust.hk/> , starting 1 Sep 2025. It contains 15 random multiple-choice questions. This is to equip students with essential information against scams and fraud, a top crime world-wide as technology advances. According to local government statistics, students are often targets of scammers. 

 

If you complete and pass the challenge after the 21 Sep 2025 due date, access to the library may take up to two workdays to resume. For enquiries, please contact the Dean of Students’ Office at antiscam@ust.hk <mailto:antiscam@ust.hk> . 

 

We would also like to share the following from the Hong Kong Government with you: 

*	Message from the Commissioner of Police on Scam Prevention <https://dst.hkust.edu.hk/upload/resources/Message_the_Commissioner_of_Poli.pdf> 
*	HK Anti-Deception Coordination Centre (ADCC) webpage on the latest scam tricks <https://www.adcc.gov.hk/en-hk/alerts.html> 

 

Most importantly, if you are in doubt, seek help. Call ADCC’s helpline at 18222 or email us at antiscam@ust.hk <mailto:antiscam@ust.hk> . Let’s be scam-smart and join hands in supporting each other for a scam-free campus!
