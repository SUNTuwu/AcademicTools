HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP

	

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) today extended its warmest congratulations to the nation and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) for the exceptional performance in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 2025 Global Innovation Index (GII). The "Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou" cluster has been ranked the 1st largest innovation cluster in the Global Innovation Index 2025 top 100 ranking, ascending from its previous position and marking a historic achievement. This rise to the top is underscored by exceptional performance metrics, with the cluster filing 2,292 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, publishing 3,775 scientific articles, and securing 135 venture capital deals—all per 1 million inhabitants over the past five years. This data reflects the cluster’s unparalleled growth and dynamic capacity for world-leading innovation.

The sustained excellence also underscores the powerful synergy and collaborative spirit within the GBA. The ranking, which this year expanded its criteria to include venture capital activity alongside patent applications and scientific publications, provides a comprehensive validation of the cluster's robust innovation ecosystem. It recognizes not only "quantitative" outputs but also "qualitative" strengths in higher education, international talent attraction, and strong capital market support.

The WIPO GII 2025 event was a significant honor for Hong Kong, marking the first time the city hosted the prestigious Global Innovation Index Science and Technology Cluster Launch. The event featured high-level panel discussions, including one titled "Greater Bay Area’s Innovation Strengths and Future Potential," moderated by HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP, and another titled "Leading Clusters from Other World Regions," moderated by Mr. Marco ALEMAN, Assistant Director General of WIPO.

In her opening address, Prof. Ip stated: "Hong Kong is exceptionally honored and thrilled to host this prestigious event for the first time. It highlights Hong Kong’s significance both as a core city of the Greater Bay Area and as a global innovation and technology hub."

She further emphasized the region's strategic importance: "The Greater Bay Area (GBA) plays a strategically important role in the nation's scientific and technological innovation system, a status clearly evidenced by its performance in the Global Innovation Index. After ranking second globally for five consecutive years, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster has now risen to claim the top position. This achievement underscores the GBA's role as a leading global performer in both innovation and economic impact. I believe this success is driven by its comprehensive innovation ecosystem, which comprises robust R&D capabilities, advanced industries, a large and dynamic market, strategic investments, solid infrastructure, sound government policy and regulation, and ample funding."

The panel of experts then delivered deeper insights into these key drivers, exploring the region’s world-class R&D capabilities, the strategic deployment of “venture capital,” and the dynamic growth of its startup community. Discussions highlighted the essential policies shaping the cluster’s success—including those related to talent attraction, financial incentives, intellectual property protection, and cross-border collaboration. The panel also examined the evolving role of universities in advancing frontier research, facilitating commercialization, and cultivating high-level talent, as well as the growing importance of international partnerships in guiding the cluster’s future development.


HKUST: An Engine of Innovation in the GBA Cluster


As a cornerstone of this top-ranked cluster, HKUST’s contributions are deeply woven into the fabric of the GBA’s innovation ecosystem. The University is a prolific generator of high-impact knowledge, consistently ranked first in the Nature Index for patent influence within China and boasting an exceptionally high patent utilization rate. This strong performance ensures that its research continues to create tangible economic and social value.

HKUST’s culture of innovation has directly nurtured a new generation of industry leaders. Its alumni and faculty are the driving force behind multiple GBA unicorns and tech giants, including global leader DJI, industrial automation powerhouse Googol Tech, Intelligent vision product leader APT Electronics, advanced smart manufacturing innovator SmartMore, a HK listed mobile sports simulation games developer GALA Sports and Zhuhai's rising star Yunzhou Tech.

This entrepreneurial pipeline is powered by the University’s robust support system, which includes four established incubators: InnoBay@CWB in Hong Kong, the Blue Bay Incubator in Shenzhen, the Guangdong-HK-Macau (International) Youth Entrepreneur Hub in Guangzhou, and the HKUST Foshan Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization in Foshan.

These physical hubs are complemented by comprehensive academic programs, including experiential-based learning for undergraduates and the master’s program in Technology Leadership and Entrepreneurship (TLE) under the Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies’ Division of Integrative Systems and Design (ISD). Together, these initiatives are designed to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators, equipping them to work across disciplines and develop disruptive innovations that address pressing societal challenges.

“The GBA’s top ranking is a resounding validation of our collective efforts,” said Prof. Nancy Ip in her concluding remarks. “Since its founding, HKUST has placed strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as an active engine for the innovation ecosystem. We have contributed significantly to the GBA’s growth story through high-impact patents—with a utilization rate of 30%—as well as an unparalleled record of nurturing unicorns, and incubators and ISD programs that empower tomorrow’s entrepreneurs. We will continue to leverage these strengths to solidify the GBA’s role as a leading international innovation hub.”

The University remains dedicated to fostering the cross-disciplinary research and international cooperation necessary to unlock the next chapter of the GBA's innovation story.
