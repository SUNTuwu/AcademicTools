Dear students,

Welcome to the 2025-26 academic year. It is with great joy that I greet you on this first day of school. This year we are excited to admit a record high of nearly 1,100 new undergraduate students, with around one-third of them coming from an impressive diversity of 29 countries and regions, including new additions from Belarus, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Rwanda, and Yemen. Similarly, we have admitted a record number of over 500 research postgraduate students and 1,600 full-time and part-time MSc students. Thank you for your trust in HKUST as the place to build your future. Together, we live out our motto, “Engineering Our Future!”
 
This year also marks a significant change in our undergraduate admissions process, with a good portion of you being admitted directly into your departments. This department-based admission allows you an early start to follow a tailored pathway specific to your chosen department, while the school-based admission provides you with the flexibility to explore various fields – offering the best of both worlds.
 
To enhance your learning experience, we have established a new leadership position for an Executive Director for Undergraduate Recruitment and Student Development in this academic year. This role is dedicated to strengthening our engagement with industry partners, creating more collaboration and internship opportunities for you. With joining forces of our leadership team of Associate Deans, Center/Program Directors, Department Heads, we are committed to enriching your experience and helping you fulfill your aspirations. 
 
Your university years may be one of the most memorable years of your life or the most critical years for your personal and professional development. As you embark on this journey, I encourage you to explore and grow beyond the classroom. From exchanges to internships, competitions to student organizations, volunteering to leadership training, each of these experiences will enrich your education and help you discover your passions and strengths.
 
As you transition to a new environment and stage of life, it is absolutely normal at times to feel frustrated and lost. Many students experience these feelings, and I want to let you know that you are not alone. Whether it’s reaching out to your friends, connecting with peer mentors, or talking to our dedicated wellness team staff, faculty members, or academic advisors, there are many people here who genuinely care and want to support you. So step out and don’t hesitate to lean on us. We’ll help you navigate this journey and discover yourself.
 
The Engineering Commons – our “home” and vibrant hub has truly become a cornerstone of our community for hosting a number of major events. I encourage you to make the most of the Commons and participate in activities there for socializing, learning and collaborating throughout your years at HKUST.
 
As a key champion in transforming engineering education, we are committed to nurturing your growth. A heartfelt welcome again to each of you. May your time at HKUST be fulfilling and unforgettable! See you around!

Sincerely,
Prof. Hong K. LO
Dean of Engineering
