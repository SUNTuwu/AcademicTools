Dear Members of the University,

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued a Black Rainstorm Warning Signal at 7:50 am this morning. Because of potential flooding and inclement weather conditions, people are advised to take shelter in a safe place and stay there. They should not attempt to travel until the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is no longer in force and traffic conditions have improved.  

 

According to the Tropical Cyclone and Rainstorm Warning Arrangement circular No. 1/2025 issued by CMO <https://cmo.ust.hk/severe-weather-information> , while a Black Rainstorm Warning is in effect, staff and students should stay indoor or take shelter in a safe place. Staff should report for duty as soon as the Warning is cancelled, if weather and transport conditions permit.  The University's top priority is staff safety.  Staff having genuine difficulties in returning to office should explain to their immediate supervisor immediately and seek approval for alternative work arrangements.

As a general rule, if the warning is cancelled at or after 12 noon on weekdays (OR at or after 8 am on Saturdays for those who are required to work on Saturday morning; OR at or after 12 noon for those who are required to work whole day on Saturday), Department Heads have the discretion to arrange staff to work from home subject to meeting operational requirements.  Staff who are on shift duties should report to work two hours after the above warning is cancelled.  According to the ARO webpage <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/bad-weather-arrangement-case-typhoon-or-rainstorm-class> , When a Black Rainstorm Warning is in force, all (including online) classes and examinations will be canceled.  Those in progress will normally continue until the end. 

For faculty with teaching duty, please follow Arrangement for Class / Exam under weather warning signals: Bad weather arrangement - In Case of Typhoon or Rainstorm (Class) | HKUST - Academic Registry <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/bad-weather-arrangement-case-typhoon-or-rainstorm-class>  and Bad weather arrangement - In case of Typhoon or Rainstorm (Final Exam) | HKUST - Academic Registry <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/bad-weather-arrangement-case-typhoon-or-rainstorm-finalexam>  respectively.

Please follow these instructions and refer to the webpages for more details.

Take care and stay safe,
