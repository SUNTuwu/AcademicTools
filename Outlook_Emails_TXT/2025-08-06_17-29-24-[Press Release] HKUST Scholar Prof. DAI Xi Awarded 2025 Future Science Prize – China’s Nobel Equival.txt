Prof. DAI Xi, Dr William M W Mong Professor of Nanoscience and Chair Professor of Physics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), has been awarded the 2025 Future Science Prize in Physical Science Prize, announced today by the Future Science Prize Committee. The honor recognizes his groundbreaking contributions to condensed matter physics and topological materials research.

Founded in 2016, the Future Science Prize is China’s first world-class science award jointly established by scientists and entrepreneurs, often regarded as China’s equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Comprising three categories: Life Science, Physical Science, as well as Mathematics and Computer Science – the Prizes honor scientists for outstanding accomplishments in these fields and exceptional contributions to research in Greater China. Each award carries a prize of up to US$1 million.

Prof. Dai Xi, a world-renowned expert in quantum materials theory, has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries throughout his career. In 2010, in collaboration with Prof. FANG Zhong, Director of the Institute of Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he theoretically predicted that the quantum anomalous Hall effect could be achieved in magnetically doped topological insulators. Three years later, this prediction was experimentally confirmed by a research team led by fellow Future Science Prize laureate - Prof. XUE Qikun, marking the first observation of this important physical effect in the scientific community.

In 2015, Prof. Dai and his team garnered widespread acclaim in the physics community by discovering the first-ever Weyl fermions in solid-state materials. This landmark achievement was selected by the prestigious journal Physical Review as one of the 49 most groundbreaking discoveries in its 125-year history, and it stands as the only work from China on the list. In 2024, Prof. Dai’s research achievements in topological electronic states earned him the State Natural Science Award (First Class) - China's highest honor in natural sciences, as well as the Tan Kah Kee Science Award in Mathematics & Physics.

Prof. Dai shares the 2025 Future Science Prize with Prof. Fang Zhong and Prof. DING Hong, Deputy Director of the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.


Hong Kong Research Breaking New Ground in Fundamental Science


Prof. Dai expressed his gratitude for the award, stating, “I am deeply thankful for the recognition from the selection committee, both for myself and my dedicated collaborators who have worked along with me throughout these years. This accolade is a testament to our perseverance. Our research has always been driven by first-principles analysis and the pursuit of exploring the essence of phenomena through real-world materials, bridging the gap between theoretical physics with experimental science. This award not only accelerates progress in the study of topological quantum matter but also strengthens China’s global leadership in this field. Going forward, I hope to further harness Hong Kong’s strategic advantages in academic research to contribute to our nation’s advancements in science and technology." 

HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP extended her heartfelt congratulations to Prof. Dai Xi on his award, stating, "Fundamental research forms the bedrock of technological innovation and carries strategic importance for strengthening nation's competitiveness. As a research university, HKUST places emphasis on pioneering breakthroughs in foundational research as well as translating research discoveries into transformative real-world solutions. This award recognizes Prof. Dai's seminal contributions to his field while underscoring HKUST's enduring commitment to foundational and translational research. We remain dedicated to providing scholars with world-class research environments where they can advance frontier knowledge, fully leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive strengths in scientific innovation." 


Bridging Theoretical Physics and Experimental Science 
to Advance Topological Quantum Materials


Prof. Dai Xi and his team’s relentless pursuit in related fields has yielded multiple transformative scientific discoveries in quantum materials. Their achievements include developing innovative computational methods to predict and verify the first quantum anomalous Hall effect insulator; pioneering advanced computational techniques that revealed the first Dirac and Weyl semimetals; and establishing the now-standard topological classification framework using non-Abelian Berry connections. These efforts have profoundly accelerated progress in the field of topological quantum matter.

His findings have been incorporated into graduate-level textbooks, cementing their importance in the academic curriculum. Moreover, these achievements have showcased the vital role of the "computation-driven experiment" research paradigm, which has significantly accelerated progress in the study of topological states. This approach has propelled the field to new heights, facilitating rapid advancements and ensuring that China remains at the forefront of international research in this field.

For years, Prof. Dai’s research accomplishments have been widely recognized internationally, including the OCPA's Achievements in Asia Award, the KC Chou Foundation's Fundamental Physics Prize, and the James C. McGroddy Prize for New Materials from the American Physical Society.

The laureates will receive their awards during October’s “Future Science Prize Week”, which will feature a series of science seminars and initiatives for the public. As a strategic partner of the Future Science Prize, HKUST will co-host a dedicated forum on science and technological innovation.
