Dear ELEC1910/2910/3910 students,

 

Welcome to the academic year 2025-26!

 

ELEC1910 (for 2025-26 intake onwards), ELEC2910, ELEC3910 are compulsory one-year Academic and Professional Development courses for BEng in Electronic Engineering students. These courses are designed to provide academic advising to students and/or to develop students' communication skills in interacting with the technical and non-technical audiences in their professional careers.

 

To help you survive in these courses, we prepared a “Tips on ELEC1910/2910/3910” as attached for your information. 

 

We strongly recommend you meet with your faculty advisor by the end of the add-drop period. Please contact your faculty advisor accordingly to make an appointment with him/her in advance. You can find your tutorial group and faculty advisor on SIS. 

 

A detailed course arrangement will be sent to you after the add/drop period. Please stay tuned for our updates.
