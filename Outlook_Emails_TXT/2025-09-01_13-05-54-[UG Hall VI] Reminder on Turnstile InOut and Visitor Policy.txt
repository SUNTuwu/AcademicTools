A resident may invite visitors to the Hall during the visitor hours, 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m. The host resident needs to escort the visitor to register electronically at the pair-up reader, and accompany the visitor in person at all times within the hall premises, including at the collection and return of Visitor Card at the Reception. The host resident will be held responsible for the conduct and safety of the visitor, or any charges or damages incurred by the visitor while s/he is in the Hall.
