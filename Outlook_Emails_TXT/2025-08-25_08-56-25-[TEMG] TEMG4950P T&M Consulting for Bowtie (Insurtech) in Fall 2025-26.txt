Dear students, 

 

Join us for a series of experiential-learning courses where student-consultants apply technology and management (T&M) strategies to solve complex problems faced by an industry-leading firm. The health insurance sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, driven by rising consumer expectations, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Bowtie was established to address the significant protection gap in the market and has since experienced rapid growth, attracting substantial investment and continuously expanding its offerings.

 

Under the guidance of the teaching team, you will apply McKinsey consulting engagement principles to create a 3-year product roadmap to enhance domestic growth, and two countries of choice to decide on an international expansion strategy. Interested students must request instructor consent and attach their latest transcript and CV starting today, 22 August. Attendance of the first TEMG4950P class meeting on Thursday Sep 4, 2025 (Thursday), 6:00pm in room 6580 is MANDATORY for student selection.
