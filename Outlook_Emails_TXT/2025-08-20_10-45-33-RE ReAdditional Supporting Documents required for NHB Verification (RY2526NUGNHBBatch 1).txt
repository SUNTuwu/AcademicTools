Dear Student Housing and Residential Life Office,

 

I am explaining the address discrepancy related to my HKDSE Certificate. The Hong Kong local address shown on the certificate is my uncle’s residence, which was used solely for receiving official correspondence during the exam process.

 

I obtained Hong Kong identity as a dependant of my mother. I have been residing at Room 404, No. 6, Lane 601, Guoding Road, Yangpu District, Shanghai all this time and had been studying here before getting the identity. Using my uncle’s Hong Kong address was just a practical arrangement for mail - receiving needs regarding the HKDSE, as my actual long - term living place has been and remains this Shanghai address.

 

I would like to consult about what documentary proof is needed for my situation? Because it seems not to comply with the requirements in your "document required".

 

Best regards,
