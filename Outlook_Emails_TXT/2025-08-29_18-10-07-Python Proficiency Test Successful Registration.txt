Dear student,

Thank you for your registration to the Python Proficiency Test.
The test will be held on campus at 8pm on 2nd September 2025. We will inform you the exact venue on or before 2pm that day.

Please be reminded again COMP 2011 and COMP 2211 are both challenging and demanding courses. Therefore, please carefully consider whether not taking COMP1023 is the best option for you. 
Taking the test will not prevent you from remaining enrolled in or taking COMP1023.

Feel free to contact us at pythontest@ust.hk <mailto:pythontest@ust.hk>  if you have any concerns or questions.

Best,
Python Proficiency Test Team
