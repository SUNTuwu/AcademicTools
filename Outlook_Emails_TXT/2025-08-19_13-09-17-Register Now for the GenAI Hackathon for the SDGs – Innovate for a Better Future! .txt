Dear Students, 

 

We are thrilled to invite you to participate in the "GenAI Hackathon for the SDGs," an innovative event jointly organized by all eight universities in Hong Kong! 

 

Running from 20th September to 1st November, this unique hackathon offers an exciting opportunity to utilize Generative AI (GenAI) to address global challenges in education, innovation, and sustainability. Unlike typical short-term hackathons, this extended event allows ample time to think creatively, develop new skills, and engage in meaningful collaboration with peers across Hong Kong. 

 

Please mark your calendars: the hackathon kicks off with a Team-Forming Day on 20th September and concludes with a Pitch Day on 1st November. Participants are expected to attend both of these key events in person. 

 

Throughout the hackathon, you'll have numerous opportunities to network with fellow innovators, attend insightful workshops on sustainability, innovation, and GenAI technologies, and compete for exciting prizes. 

 

Choose from four impactful thematic tracks: 

1.	Youth Empowerment and Inclusion 

2.	Social Resilience and Adaptation 

3.	Sustainable Design and Biodiversity 

4.	Artistic and Cultural Innovation 

 

This hackathon is not only a chance to win awards but also a platform for driving meaningful change and launching your entrepreneurial journey. 

 

Spots are limited, so we encourage you to register before 15th September. Remember, all team members must register individually.
