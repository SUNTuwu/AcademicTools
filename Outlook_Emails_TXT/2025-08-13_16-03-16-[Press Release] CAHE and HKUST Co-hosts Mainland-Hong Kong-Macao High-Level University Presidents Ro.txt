The meeting brought together leaders from 15 top-tier universities and research institutions, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, Xiamen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Westlake University, Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), City University of Hong Kong (CityU), and the University of Macau. Over 70 representatives from the higher education sector, as well as government officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee, LOCPG, the Ministry of Education, and the HKSAR Education Bureau participated in discussions on higher education development strategies.


Promoting Research Collaboration and Leveraging the Greater Bay Area's Strengths


In his keynote address, Minister Huai pointed out that "Education constitutes the most profound, enduring, and gigantic force for achieving national strength and prosperity. It is a key element for sustained economic prosperity and the core 'secret code' for enhancing a nation's comprehensive competitive strength. We must gain a more accurate understanding and grasp of President and General Secretary XI Jinping's important remarks on education. Within the new coordinates of education and Chinese-style modernization, as well as Chinese education and the world, we must clearly discern the profound transformation in the internal and external environment of education, and thereby grasp the contemporary position, historical responsibilities, and major tasks of education."

Minister Huai emphasized that the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is accelerating, and the world has entered an era of innovation-driven development. In the meantime, the acceleration of interdisciplinary integration has created new historical opportunities for the development of higher education. It is necessary to establish a new concept of education, organically integrating the missions of talent cultivation, educational development, and scientific and technological innovation, moving from the narrow logic of educational development to the broader logic of serving the construction of a modernized strong nation and promoting the development of global higher education. 

“We must fully leverage the synergistic advantages of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in terms of industry, science and education, finance, and international cooperation to accelerate the construction of regional technology transfer centers for universities across the country. We should gather the efforts from government, industry, academia, research, and finance to establish new mechanisms for the integrated development of scientific, technological and industrial innovation. We should actively support the Alliance for Open Life Sciences in launching the world-class scientific journals as initiating and participating in Mega Science programs. To meet the demands of the digital age, we must actively support universities in Hong Kong and Macao in strengthening their forward-looking layout in artificial intelligence and promoting the transformation of education empowered by artificial intelligence,” he added.

Minister Huai also stated that the construction of an education powerhouse is a systematic project. He hopes that universities in the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao will align with the goals and tasks of building a strong nation through education, work in tandem, and move forward together. It is essential to further leverage the unique role of Hong Kong and Macao to promote Hong Kong as an international education center as well as global innovation and talent hub. We must continue to strengthen cooperation and exchanges with world-class universities and successfully host the "World's Top Universities Forum."

Mr. Chan Kwok-Ki, Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government, said, "Hong Kong’s higher education sector has consistently leveraged its strengths to advance national educational development goals. Under the unique advantages under the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems', Hong Kong ranks among the world’s top five in overall education competitiveness and boasts five universities within the global top 100. In the coming decade, as China enters a golden era of rapid educational advancement, the HKSAR Government will steadfastly fulfill Hong Kong’s role as an international bridge and gateway. We will fully promote the internationalization and diversification of higher education, deepen collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland institutions, and foster future-leading talents and scientific elites—all contributing to building China into an education powerhouse and advancing national rejuvenation."

Lin Huiqing, President of the CAHE said, “The national blueprint for building China into an education powerhouse and its three-year action agenda are being comprehensively advanced and accelerated. Universities in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao constitute vital components of our self-reliant and high-calibre higher education system, serving as cornerstone forces in this national endeavour. Platforms such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao University Alliance have facilitated cross-regional faculty exchange, student mobility, and research resource sharing. Through concerted efforts between higher education institutions in Hong Kong/Macao and mainland research organizations, a series of internationally impactful achievements have been produced.”

She stated, “Accelerating the development of an education powerhouse represents both an honourable mission and historic responsibility jointly shouldered by universities across the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao. CAHE remains steadfast in aligning with national development priorities. We focus on advancing education powerhouse construction by leveraging our unique strengths as an academic society to deepen scholarly research, think tank development, international cooperation, educational governance, and public service. Looking ahead, CAHE will continue uniting member institutions and collaborating with universities throughout the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao to make new and greater contributions toward enhancing higher education cooperation and serving the national education powerhouse initiative.”

President Prof. Nancy IP of HKUST stated at the meeting, "HKUST is proud to serve as the host institution for this roundtable meeting and is excited to collaborate with top-tier universities and institutions from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao in establishing the Alliance of Open Life Sciences. As China advances its vision of becoming an education powerhouse, its universities must embrace a more prominent global role. Hong Kong’s academic institutions, with their internationally competitive research environment and innovative capacity, are uniquely positioned to drive this mission forward. HKUST sees this meeting as an opportunity to promote ongoing resource integration and institutional innovation among universities across the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao, while strengthening international cooperation in education and research. We remain committed to advancing the national strategy of revitalizing China through science and education, positioning Hong Kong as an international higher education hub, and enhancing regional and global educational collaboration."

Three Core Themes, Five Key Directions: Building a Path to an Education Nation


The roundtable meeting explored how world-class universities can seize opportunities amid complex global dynamics, strengthen exchanges, and deepen open collaboration. Discussions centered on three themes: "Universities' Role in National Development," "The Greater Bay Area’s Contribution to an Education Nation," and "Hong Kong and Macao’s Responsibilities in Educational Advancement." Participants engaged in in-depth dialogues on interdisciplinary innovation, international research collaboration, open paradigms in life sciences, and preparations for a Global Summit of University Presidents.

The meeting emphasized the imperative of implementing national education strategies, establishing high-level academic platforms, and promoting mutual learning among global institutions. Mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao universities must synergize strategically, utilizing the Greater Bay Area platform and Hong Kong’s bridging role to advance internationalization. Key action areas include:
1.    Upholding moral education to cultivate next-generation talent for national rejuvenation.
2.    Enhancing resource integration to expand talent development pathways.
3.    Strengthening research collaboration to build innovation hubs.
4.    Driving digital transformation in education.
5.    Serving as a nexus for international cooperation.

To bolster partnerships, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, Xiamen University, and Sun Yat-sen University signed agreements with HKUST, CUHK, PolyU, CityU, HKU, and the University of Macau respectively, covering research, talent development, and academic exchanges. 

A key highlight was the signing of a carbon neutrality cooperation agreement between HKUST and Tsinghua University. The partnership will combine both institutions' research strengths in environmental science, renewable energy, advanced materials, and artificial intelligence to develop low-carbon technologies and accelerate green transformation.

Through this collaboration, the universities aim to advance multilateral cooperation on carbon neutrality and smart energy systems, helping achieve global carbon neutrality goals.
