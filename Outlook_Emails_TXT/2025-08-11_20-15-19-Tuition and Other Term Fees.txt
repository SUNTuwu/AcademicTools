Tuition and other fees for  Fall 2025-26 have been posted. Please check the fee details at your Student Center of the Student Information System (SIS) via Student Intranet (https://hkust.edu.hk/stu_intranet/ <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhkust.edu.hk%2Fstu_intranet%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cxlilv%40connect.ust.hk%7C2865bf1086de4c26f80908ddd8d0ba67%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638905113187059079%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5%2B%2FO%2FVQEImOmXNxYoZoJYq9hBnX0JEDTPnZb0qsb1UI%3D&reserved=0> ). In SIS, a function “PRINT” is available for you to view the information of the unpaid charges. You are advised to save a copy of the tuition notice before you make payment. You may also download document with both paid and unpaid charges for particular term by clicking "Summary of Charges" and select the charge term as appropriate.

 

Tuition fee will be due on 2 September 2025. Payment methods are detailed at https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/payment-methods <https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/payment-methods> .  It will take a few days for payment record update in SIS, and early payment before due date is recommended.

 

Students who have  financial hardship or need to wait for the release of government Grant/Loan or Non-mean-tested Loan Scheme (NLS) to settle the tuition should apply <https://sfao.ust.hk/page.php?i=24#UGDefer>  for deferred payment of tuition fee well before the due date. If there are questions on payment deferral, please contact the Scholarships and Financial Aid Office (SFAO) at sfao.fa@ust.hk <mailto:sfao.fa@ust.hk> .
