Dear Engineering Students,

 

"How to be successful in life? And what does it even mean?"

"What career do you want to pursue after graduation?"

"What matter in your university life besides CGA?" 

 

There are no one-size-fits-all answers to these big questions and no one else can answer them for you. If you have not yet discovered your own answers, the "Design Your Life" course is exactly what you need. It is one of the most popular elective courses at Stanford and has been transferring to many universities including Harvard, Yale, MIT and many more.

Here is the good news for you. Certified trainers from Career Center will bring you the "Design Your Life" course ENGG1400 customized for SENG students.

ENGG1400 (Designing Your Life for Engineering Students) would be offered in Fall 2025-26. With the professional trainers from Career Center, a design thinking approach would be adopted to help engineering students develop a constructive and effective approach to finding and designing their vocation after university. Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, students will learn how to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfilment.

 

If you would like to have an all-round life planning after graduation, please enrol ENGG1400 in Fall 2025-26!
