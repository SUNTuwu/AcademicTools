Dear all Engineering UG Students, 

 

Autonomous Blimp Design and Competition

 

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Cheng Kar-Shun Robotics Institute (HKUST CKSRI) serves as a multidisciplinary hub dedicated to advancing robotics and autonomous systems through breakthroughs in sensor technology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It aims to foster cutting-edge research, industry collaboration, entrepreneurship, and societal impact.

 

The "Autonomous Blimp Design and Competition," one of the most significant events in the local academic community, is hosted this year by CKSRI. To help participants achieve optimal performance, CKSRI has organized a series of training workshops, online training sessions with instructors, and practice workshops. Supported by the Innovation and Technology Commission, the top-performing teams will qualify for the competition, which challenges participants to compete in teams, testing their skills in robot programming, control, strategic decision-making, and teamwork. 

 

The competition is divided into two categories: secondary school and university divisions. 

 

This project provides students with a platform to integrate their knowledge and skills into the design and construction of intelligent robots, enabling them to explore their interests and potential in robotics science and engineering.
