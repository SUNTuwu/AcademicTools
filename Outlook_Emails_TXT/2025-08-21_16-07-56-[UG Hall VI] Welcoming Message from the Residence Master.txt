Dear residents, 

 

Welcome you to your new home, Hall VI.

 

I am Marshal, the Residence Master of this hall. I am also a professor from the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Associate Director of the Center for Engineering Education Innovation (E2I).

 

As you may agree, university is never just about academic study. It provides various opportunities for your whole-person development, including a vibrant hall life. Hall VI is known for its peaceful, harmonious, accommodating, and self-disciplined environment. With over 600 residents, we are a big family that values consideration, inclusion, progress, and pleasant residential experiences.

 

Living here will give you the chance to make new friends, communicate with different people, learn from each other, and develop all aspects of your life. Please try to join the activities organized by the Hall Education team at different times.

 

But, with the freedom and fun of hall life comes responsibility and hall regulations. Remember,

 

Be Inclusive: Embrace the diversity of our community.

Be Respectful: Treat everyone with courtesy and respect.

Be Considerate: Stop making noise during quiet hours to ensure a peaceful environment for all.

Stay Healthy: No-smoking is allowed in the whole campus and no-alcohol is allowed in all halls.

 

For any problems about hall life or your personal life, welcome to contact your floor tutors (listed below), the Residential Life Officer Ms. Sherice Wong, or me. Let's treasure this common residential experience, enjoy your new home, and support each other.
