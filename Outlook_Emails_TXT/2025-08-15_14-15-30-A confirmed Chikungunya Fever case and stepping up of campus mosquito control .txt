Dear Members of the University,

 

We were notified by the Government Centre for Health Protection (CHP) this morning that one of our students living on campus is a confirmed case of Chikungunya Fever 基孔肯雅熱. The patient recently traveled outside of Hong Kong and therefore is likely an imported case.

 

Chikungunya Fever is caused by a virus, and is transmitted by mosquito only. The disease is self-limiting, meaning most people recover by themselves after suffering the symptoms of fever and joint pain for a period of time.

CMO has been stepping up mosquito control in the past weeks following Government advice, and they will now further improve environmental hygiene to reduce mosquito population. Members are also reminded to protect themselves well against mosquito bites and prevent mosquito proliferation in their living environment.
