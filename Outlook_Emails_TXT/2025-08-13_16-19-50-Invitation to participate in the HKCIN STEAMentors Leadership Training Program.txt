Dear all Engineering UG Students,


STEAMentors Leadership Training Program

 



 

Hong Kong Children in Need Foundation (HKCIN), a distinguished non-profit organization established in 2019, is committed to providing exceptional STEAM education opportunities to all students in Hong Kong on an equal footing. 

 

The "STEAMentors Leadership Training Program" is designed to shape Hong Kong's university students into well-rounded leaders in the STEAM field. 

 

Through 24 hours of immersive training in STEAM tools and teaching methods, such as Arduino, programming languages, creative teaching, and project planning, coupled with a 6-hour teaching internship, participants will be equipped to impart STEAM knowledge to local primary school students. By expanding young minds, igniting creativity, and instilling a sense of social responsibility, we aim to foster a positive outlook, enhance adaptability and persistence—traits highly valued by prospective employers.

 

Following the training, university students will have the opportunity to be remunerated for their teaching services in STEAM workshops and offer guidance to primary school children participating in various initiatives.
