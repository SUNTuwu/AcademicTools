Dear students,
 
 
You are receiving this message because you have been pre-enrolled in the course MATH1013 (Calculus I) this coming Fall term.  I have already received a number of enquiries from you regarding how to decide on the appropriate first-year calculus course.  If you have similar concerns, please refer to the "important message" posted on our Canvas website:
https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/66058
 
Here is a rough guideline for choosing the calculus course that is suitable for you:

Please note that since there are some new arrangements about first-year calculus courses starting from this year, some "academic advice" that you may find online for past cohorts may no longer be valid now.  Please discuss with your academic advisor about your own program requirements.  You're also welcome to discuss with me or the course instructor of your section; we'll try to help as much as we can.
 
 
Best regards,
