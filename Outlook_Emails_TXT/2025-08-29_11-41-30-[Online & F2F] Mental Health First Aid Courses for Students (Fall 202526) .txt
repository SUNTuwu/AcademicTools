Dear Students,

Hope you are staying healthy and well.    

The World Health Organization(WHO) states that mental health is an integral and essential component of health.  It was estimated worldwide that up to 20% of children and adolescents experience various severity of mental disorders. In order to equip our university community with knowledge and skills to address mental health concerns, we are pleased to deliver a 12-hour Mental Health First Aid course <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmhfa.com.au%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cxlilv%40connect.ust.hk%7Cf14aedc6a7674cacb59d08dde6aded1f%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638920356897246766%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=HXlvkXcgCaEA%2FoCmr6sBZkictpf1r2erCC0pvth8Y%2FE%3D&reserved=0>  to all students and faculty/staff on a regular basis.  In the past decade, over 2,500 students and 700 faculty/staff have completed this course and become Mental Health First Aiders. We highly encourage you to participate in this course if you would like to take part in building a healthier place for the community.  You may find the details of the course below.
