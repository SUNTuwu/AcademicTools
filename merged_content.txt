Prof. DAI Xi, Dr William M W Mong Professor of Nanoscience and Chair Professor of Physics at HKUST.



	



Prof. DAI Xi, Dr William M W Mong Professor of Nanoscience and Chair Professor of Physics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), has been awarded the 2025 Future Science Prize in Physical Science Prize, announced today by the Future Science Prize Committee. The honor recognizes his groundbreaking contributions to condensed matter physics and topological materials research.



Founded in 2016, the Future Science Prize is China’s first world-class science award jointly established by scientists and entrepreneurs, often regarded as China’s equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Comprising three categories: Life Science, Physical Science, as well as Mathematics and Computer Science – the Prizes honor scientists for outstanding accomplishments in these fields and exceptional contributions to research in Greater China. Each award carries a prize of up to US$1 million.



Prof. Dai Xi, a world-renowned expert in quantum materials theory, has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries throughout his career. In 2010, in collaboration with Prof. FANG Zhong, Director of the Institute of Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he theoretically predicted that the quantum anomalous Hall effect could be achieved in magnetically doped topological insulators. Three years later, this prediction was experimentally confirmed by a research team led by fellow Future Science Prize laureate - Prof. XUE Qikun, marking the first observation of this important physical effect in the scientific community.



In 2015, Prof. Dai and his team garnered widespread acclaim in the physics community by discovering the first-ever Weyl fermions in solid-state materials. This landmark achievement was selected by the prestigious journal Physical Review as one of the 49 most groundbreaking discoveries in its 125-year history, and it stands as the only work from China on the list. In 2024, Prof. Dai’s research achievements in topological electronic states earned him the State Natural Science Award (First Class) - China's highest honor in natural sciences, as well as the Tan Kah Kee Science Award in Mathematics & Physics.



Prof. Dai shares the 2025 Future Science Prize with Prof. Fang Zhong and Prof. DING Hong, Deputy Director of the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.





Hong Kong Research Breaking New Ground in Fundamental Science





Prof. Dai expressed his gratitude for the award, stating, “I am deeply thankful for the recognition from the selection committee, both for myself and my dedicated collaborators who have worked along with me throughout these years. This accolade is a testament to our perseverance. Our research has always been driven by first-principles analysis and the pursuit of exploring the essence of phenomena through real-world materials, bridging the gap between theoretical physics with experimental science. This award not only accelerates progress in the study of topological quantum matter but also strengthens China’s global leadership in this field. Going forward, I hope to further harness Hong Kong’s strategic advantages in academic research to contribute to our nation’s advancements in science and technology." 



HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP extended her heartfelt congratulations to Prof. Dai Xi on his award, stating, "Fundamental research forms the bedrock of technological innovation and carries strategic importance for strengthening nation's competitiveness. As a research university, HKUST places emphasis on pioneering breakthroughs in foundational research as well as translating research discoveries into transformative real-world solutions. This award recognizes Prof. Dai's seminal contributions to his field while underscoring HKUST's enduring commitment to foundational and translational research. We remain dedicated to providing scholars with world-class research environments where they can advance frontier knowledge, fully leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive strengths in scientific innovation." 





Bridging Theoretical Physics and Experimental Science 

to Advance Topological Quantum Materials





Prof. Dai Xi and his team’s relentless pursuit in related fields has yielded multiple transformative scientific discoveries in quantum materials. Their achievements include developing innovative computational methods to predict and verify the first quantum anomalous Hall effect insulator; pioneering advanced computational techniques that revealed the first Dirac and Weyl semimetals; and establishing the now-standard topological classification framework using non-Abelian Berry connections. These efforts have profoundly accelerated progress in the field of topological quantum matter.



His findings have been incorporated into graduate-level textbooks, cementing their importance in the academic curriculum. Moreover, these achievements have showcased the vital role of the "computation-driven experiment" research paradigm, which has significantly accelerated progress in the study of topological states. This approach has propelled the field to new heights, facilitating rapid advancements and ensuring that China remains at the forefront of international research in this field.



For years, Prof. Dai’s research accomplishments have been widely recognized internationally, including the OCPA's Achievements in Asia Award, the KC Chou Foundation's Fundamental Physics Prize, and the James C. McGroddy Prize for New Materials from the American Physical Society.



The laureates will receive their awards during October’s “Future Science Prize Week”, which will feature a series of science seminars and initiatives for the public. As a strategic partner of the Future Science Prize, HKUST will co-host a dedicated forum on science and technological innovation.

Witnessed by HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP (right in back row) and Vice-chairman of the 10th ALL-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the President of China Peaceful Development General Summit of Hong Kong Macao Taiwan Diaspora Dr. LO Man-Tuen (left in back row), HKUST Vice-President for Research and Development Prof. Tim CHENG (right in front row), and President of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong and CHMT Chairman Dr. LO Kam-Wing (left in front row) sign the MoU. This collaboration will foster research, education, and technological advances in new energy technology to promote sustainable development. 



	



The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and C.H.M.T. Peaceful Development Fund Management Limited (CHMT) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking a pivotal moment in accelerating new energy innovation through industry-academia-research collaboration. By combining HKUST’s world-class research capabilities with CHMT’s market expertise, the partnership will bridge laboratory breakthroughs with commercial deployment. The initiative seeks to drive advancements in new energy technology and sustainable development in line with the carbon neutrality ambitions in the 14th Five-Year Plan. 



The signing ceremony, held at HKUST, was witnessed by HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP and Dr. LO Man-Tuen, Vice-chairman of the 10th All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and President of the China Peaceful Development General Summit of Hong Kong, Macao & Taiwan Diaspora. The MoU was signed by HKUST Vice-President for Research and Development Prof. Tim CHENG and Dr. LO Kam-Wing, Chairman of CHMT and President of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong.



The partnership will foster energy innovation, explore pathways for translating scientific research into market-ready solutions, and broaden cooperative networks through cross-sector collaboration. 





Academic-Industry Collaboration: Co-creating a Green Future





HKUST Vice-President for Research and Development Prof. Tim CHENG said, “Energy transition and sustainable development are critical global priorities. Through this partnership, HKUST and CHMT will synergize cutting-edge research – from next-gen energy storage to renewable energy and system optimization solutions, with industrial scalability, directly supporting the nation’s strategic priorities and positioning Hong Kong as a global leader in energy innovation. The HKUST Energy Institute is committed to fostering breakthroughs that enhance energy resilience, reduce carbon intensity and contribute to the Greater Bay Area's development as a global hub for green innovation. Backed by rich resources, deep expertise, and a vast business network, CHMT—guided by its mission to foster peaceful development across Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the diaspora—will strongly support HKUST in translating research into practical solutions." 



Dr. LO Kam-Wing, President of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong and the Chairman of CHMT, remarked, “As an investment firm with extensive fund management expertise, CHMT has successfully supported and nurtured multiple projects with significant social impact. We are excited to collaborate with HKUST, leveraging our combined strengths while aligning with the HKSAR Government’s innovation policies to drive research commercialization and pioneer new energy solutions. This partnership will champion a government-industry-academia-research-investment model, transforming lab innovations into market-ready solutions and contributing to green, low-carbon progress for Hong Kong and the nation.” 





Focusing on New Energy Technology and Translating Scientific Research into Market-ready Solutions





New energy technology is a strategic emerging industry put forth in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Developing advanced new energy technology industries helps combat global climate challenges, accelerates the achievement of carbon neutrality targets, and drives sustainable development. The HKUST-CHMT partnership will focus on three key areas: 



*	Research Commercialization: Explore collaborative ventures in energy and sustainability development, and leveraging CHMT’s incubation platform to commercialize HKUST’s innovations;

*	Innovative Energy Solutions: Co-develop novel energy technologies applicable to CHMT’s needs, advancing sustainable energy development locally and nationally; 

*	Knowledge Exchange Hub: Deepen knowledge sharing through diverse projects and activities. 



The HKUST Energy Institute and CHMT will collaborate closely to harness industry-academia-research synergies to drive energy transition and shape a sustainable future. Established in 2014, the HKUST Energy Institute offers an interdisciplinary platform through energy-focused research and programs, contributing expertise to build future economic, reliable, and sustainable energy systems. CHMT, founded in 2017, brings extensive investment fund management experience, having managed projects worth over HKD 40 billion while providing comprehensive capital-raising and advisory services.

Dear LI, Xueyang (SID: 21308259),



 



For your attention, we noticed that xlilv@connect.ust.hk <mailto:xlilv@connect.ust.hk>  <mailto:cilo@connect.ust.hk>  is now your default email in registration record. Please refer to the instructions of Checklist <https://nso.hkust.edu.hk/important-item-checklist-new-students>  for new students and activate your account first. You are recommended to directly contact us with your HKUST email for inquiries onward once it activated, which is the main channel for us to communicate with students. Please note that we will stop answering emails from non-HKUST emails when the semester starts.



 



Regarding your inquiries, please find our clarification in green as follows. 



 



1.	We are not verifying NHB proofs via email correspondence. Submission by channels other than the online portal is not accepted. Please ensure to upload correct documents onto respective sections. Combine your justification on the local address with your DSE certificate into one PDF file and upload as the required NHB proof 9(d).



 



2.	The instructions above textbox should be self-explanatory. Please input your full home address either in Chinese or English. 



 



Upon recent check, we have not yet received your Residential Year 2025-26 hall application. Should you wish for a hall place in the upcoming year, please submit hall application form within announced period. 



 



Thank you for your understanding. 



 



 



Best regards,



Student Housing and Residential Life Office

Subject: Inquiries Regarding NoHomeBase Documents from Student ID: 21308259



 



Dear Student Housing and Residential Life Office,



 



I hope this email finds you well. I have two questions that I would greatly appreciate your assistance with.



 



1)First, I would like to request that you kindly check whether the documents I provided are comprehensive and meet the requirements. I'm not entirely certain if I've included everything necessary, and your professional assessment would be invaluable. I have attached the relevant documents in the email for your review.



 



Also, I have written the statement regarding "If your HKDSE Certificate shows a Hong Kong local address instead of your claimed address outside of Hong Kong, you must provide an explanation." in the attachment "Student's education history". Do I need to make this statement elsewhere?



 



The specific statement is as follows: The Hong Kong address on the certificate is my uncle's, used only for receiving exam - related mail. I got my Hong Kong identity as my mother's dependent. I've always lived at Room 404, No. 6, Lane 601, Guoding Road, Yangpu District, Shanghai, and studied here up to now. Using my uncle's address was just for HKDSE mail - receiving, my long - term address is in Shanghai.



 



2) Second, I'm a bit confused about a particular field in the application form. I would like to inquire about the function of this field and what kind of information should be filled in it. The following are the parts I'm in doubt about. I've provided the screenshot.⬇️







 



Thank you so much for your time and help. I look forward to your reply.



 



Best regards,

尊敬的Student Housing and Residential Life Office：



 



您好！我有两个问题，希望能得到您的帮助。



 



其一，烦请您帮忙查看我所提供的文件是否齐全，是否符合要求。我不太确定自己是否已准备好所有必需材料，您的专业评估对我至关重要。相关文件已附在邮件中，供您查阅。



 



另外，关于“若您的香港中学文凭考试证书显示的是香港本地地址，而非您所声称的香港以外地址，则必须提供解释说明” 这一要求，我已将说明写在附件“Student's education history”中。请问我还需要在其他地方作出此声明吗？



 



具体说明如下：证书上显示的香港本地地址是我姨夫的住址，仅用于在考试期间接收官方信件。我是以母亲受养人的身份获得香港身份的。直至今日我和我的父母一直居住在上海市杨浦区国定路601弄6号404室，一直在上海本地读书。使用叔叔的香港地址只是出于香港中学文凭考试接收信件的实际需求，我长期居住的地址一直都是上海的这个地址。



 



其二，我对申请表中的一个特定栏目有些疑惑。我想了解该栏目的作用以及应该填写何种信息。以下是我有疑问的地方，我已附上截图⬇️







 



非常感谢您抽出时间帮忙。期待您的回复!



 



此致



敬礼！

Dear LI, Xueyang,



 



Tuition and other fees for  Fall 2025-26 have been posted. Please check the fee details at your Student Center of the Student Information System (SIS) via Student Intranet (https://hkust.edu.hk/stu_intranet/ <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhkust.edu.hk%2Fstu_intranet%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cxlilv%40connect.ust.hk%7C2865bf1086de4c26f80908ddd8d0ba67%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638905113187059079%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5%2B%2FO%2FVQEImOmXNxYoZoJYq9hBnX0JEDTPnZb0qsb1UI%3D&reserved=0> ). In SIS, a function “PRINT” is available for you to view the information of the unpaid charges. You are advised to save a copy of the tuition notice before you make payment. You may also download document with both paid and unpaid charges for particular term by clicking "Summary of Charges" and select the charge term as appropriate.



 



Tuition fee will be due on 2 September 2025. Payment methods are detailed at https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/payment-methods <https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/payment-methods> .  It will take a few days for payment record update in SIS, and early payment before due date is recommended.



 



Students who have  financial hardship or need to wait for the release of government Grant/Loan or Non-mean-tested Loan Scheme (NLS) to settle the tuition should apply <https://sfao.ust.hk/page.php?i=24#UGDefer>  for deferred payment of tuition fee well before the due date. If there are questions on payment deferral, please contact the Scholarships and Financial Aid Office (SFAO) at sfao.fa@ust.hk <mailto:sfao.fa@ust.hk> .



 



Please note that Caution Money and Compulsory Medical Insurance are not deferrable. Tuition fee paid is normally not refundable.

发件人: itso-info-ms-storage-update-std-request@lists.ust.hk
--------------------正文--------------------

 







Dear Student, 



We would like to inform you about the recent changes to your Microsoft student account storage, in line with the Global Microsoft 365 Education updates <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/microsoft-365-storage-options>  affecting universities worldwide. Under these changes, HKUST student Email Mailboxes will be adjusted to 15 GB, and the OneDrive quota will be adjusted to 50 GB.



 



Newly created HKUST student accounts in the current cohort will be assigning these new storage quotas. Existing students will be gradually transitioned to the new quotas by 31 October 2025.



 



Detailed updates to all HKUST Student Accounts <https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/general-it-services/user-account/student/student-account#Updates-Std-Account>  and suggested good practices: 



Email: 



*	The quota will be adjusted to 15GB.

*	Once your mailbox reaches 90% capacity, the Archive Mailbox <https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/general-it-services/communication-collaboration/email/exchange-online/archive-mailbox>  will be automatically activated in Outlook, and emails older than two years will be moved to this Archive Mailbox, freeing up space and not counting towards your storage quota.



 



Please note that your HKUST student email account serves as the University’s official communication channel. Please regularly delete unnecessary emails <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/mailbox-storage-limits-in-outlook-f170fe90-b859-4034-bcda-e186fc6a26f5>  and saving large attachments to other storage to ensure you continue to receive important emails from the University. 



 OneDrive:



*	The quota will be gradually adjusted to 50GB.



*	When OneDrive usage exceeds the quota, access will be restricted to read/download/delete functions only.



 



Please review your OneDrive and clean up unnecessary files <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/delete-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-21fe345a-e488-4fa7-932b-f053c1bebe8a>  to stay within the quota. 



Need Help? 



*	Email: cchelp@ust.hk <mailto:cchelp@ust.hk?subject=Important%20Notice:%20Changes%20to%20Microsoft%20365%20Storage%20for%20HKUST%20Alumni%20Accounts>  or Call: +852 2358 6200 

*	Forgot password? Please use: Retrieve your username <https://w5.ab.ust.hk/jsan/o_login_all>  or Forgot password <https://myaccount.ust.hk/passwd/forget?execution=e1s1> 

*	For details: Microsoft 365 Storage Global Reduction <https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/general-it-services/m365-storage-quota-update>

主题: Call for Application | UROP Fall 2025-26
时间: 2025-08-12 09:59:52
发件人: allug-list-request@lists.ust.hk
--------------------正文--------------------

Dear Students,



 



The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) is now accepting applications for Fall 2025-26. Schedule for UROP Fall 2025-26 can be found here <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/schedule> .



 



Course Types:



*   The Series Stream (UROP1100/2100/3100/4100) is a 1-credit course and a prerequisite of P* (Pass to Proceed) grade is required for students to continue the course series at a higher level under the same project, e.g., receiving P* in UROP1100 in order to enroll in UROP2100.



*   The 1-credit UROP3200 course (Undergraduate Research Opportunities with Mini-conference Experience) is now offered as a Common Core UxOP Course. For more details of UROP3200, please refer to the webpage HERE <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/urop3200_projects> . 



(Note: The on-campus Mini-conference for Fall 2025-26 is tentatively scheduled to be held in the afternoon of 1 December 2025 (Monday). Students should reserve your time for the event.)



 



Eligibility Requirements:



*   First-time UROP participant is required to have enrolled in a full-time degree-bearing program for at least two semesters at HKUST and attained a minimum CGA of 3.30 for UROP1100. For students who have completed UROP1000 before, this requirement can be waived.



*   UROP participants are expected to fulfil the CGA requirement of 3.0 (for UROP1000) or 3.3 (for UROP1100). To allow more students with research potentials to join UROP, effective from Summer 2023-24, supervisors are allowed to provide strong justification with substantial grounds to support applications from students who fail to meet the CGA requirements but demonstrate research competencies. Such justification should include:



*	Student’s achievement of related awards, contests and/or other activities 

*	Student’s previous research experience and/or research skills 

*	Student’s academic performance in related course(s) and/or coursework



Students should submit a study plan in which they specify how they will manage their projects throughout the semester. The UROP Office reserves the right of final decision on the eligibility of any students under exceptional consideration.



 



*   For UROP 3200, a prerequisite of TWO passing grades in TWO UROP1100 courses OR TWO passing grades in UROP1100 and UROP2100 is required. 



*   Students are advised to discuss with the project supervisors on how the project will be conducted. 



 



Application Procedures:



For UROP1100/2100/3100/3200/4100



*   Visit the Courses <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/courses>  and Information for Students <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/For_Students>  pages for details.



*   For the usage details of the Online System, please check out the UROP Online Student Application System Guidebook <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/guidelines/UROP%20System%20-%20Guideline%20for%20Student.pdf> .



*   Browse the UROP Project Listing <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/projects>  to find your interested project(s) and contact the corresponding supervisors for consent.



*   Apply through the UROP Online System <http://uropos.ust.hk/>  by uploading the required documents.



*   Deadline: 3 September 2025 (Wednesday)



*   Students who wish to seek special consideration must submit their applications, study plans and supervisors’ supporting letters one week before the deadline above, i.e., 27 August 2025 (Wednesday).  Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.  



 



Important Notes:



*   Each student can only submit ONE online application for each semester. You are recommended to contact and consult the project supervisor of your interested project(s) prior to submitting an online application or if you would like to propose new project topics.



*   For UROP students of Summer 2024-25 who wish to continue the UROP series (i.e., UROP2100/3100/4100) in Fall 2025-26: the UROP report and a P* (Pass to Proceed) grade must be received and checked by the UROP Office BEFORE you submit an online application.



 



Additional Course Completion Requirement:



*   Effective from Spring 2022-23, apart from the submission of a final report, all UROP students are required to complete an online training of “Responsible Conduct of Research” (RCR). The training aims to equip students with knowledge of good practices on conducting research. 



*   You are required to watch all the lecture videos and complete the quizzes of all 10 required and supplemental modules (if any, as project supervisors may require their students to complete supplemental modules based on their project nature), within one month after the end of the add/drop period, 13 October 2025 (Monday), at the latest.



*   Please submit the completion report to the UROP Office via email at urop@ust.hk <mailto:urop@ust.hk>  for checking by 20 October 2025 (Monday).



*   To complete the RCR training, students should complete the quiz (3-5 MC questions) at the end of each required (and supplemental) module and obtain at least 80% for each. Quizzes can be re-attempted as many times as needed until the requirement is met. Students who fail the RCR training course will receive a Fail grade in the UROP course. 



*   UROP students who have taken the training and obtained a Pass in each required module in previous semester do NOT need to do the training and submit the report again.



*   Please refer to the guidelines HERE <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/For_Students>  for more information on the training.

The "Mainland-Hong Kong-Macao High-Level University Presidents Roundtable" hosted by the China Association of Higher Education (CAHE) and co-organized by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), was successfully held in Hong Kong yesterday. Themed "University Missions and Collaborative Innovation in the Context of Building an Education Nation," the event featured a keynote speech by HUAI Jinpeng, Minister of Education of China, with opening remarks by CHAN Kwok-Ki, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, and LIN Huiqing, President of the China Association of Higher Education.



The roundtable also witnessed the inauguration of the "Alliance of Open Life Science," officially launched under the joint witness of Minister Huai Jinpeng, LUO Yonggang, Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR (LOCPG), CAHE President Lin Huiqing, and Dr. CHOI Yuk-Lin, Secretary for Education of the HKSAR Government.



The meeting brought together leaders from 15 top-tier universities and research institutions, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, Xiamen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Westlake University, Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), City University of Hong Kong (CityU), and the University of Macau. Over 70 representatives from the higher education sector, as well as government officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee, LOCPG, the Ministry of Education, and the HKSAR Education Bureau participated in discussions on higher education development strategies.





Promoting Research Collaboration and Leveraging the Greater Bay Area's Strengths





In his keynote address, Minister Huai pointed out that "Education constitutes the most profound, enduring, and gigantic force for achieving national strength and prosperity. It is a key element for sustained economic prosperity and the core 'secret code' for enhancing a nation's comprehensive competitive strength. We must gain a more accurate understanding and grasp of President and General Secretary XI Jinping's important remarks on education. Within the new coordinates of education and Chinese-style modernization, as well as Chinese education and the world, we must clearly discern the profound transformation in the internal and external environment of education, and thereby grasp the contemporary position, historical responsibilities, and major tasks of education."



Minister Huai emphasized that the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is accelerating, and the world has entered an era of innovation-driven development. In the meantime, the acceleration of interdisciplinary integration has created new historical opportunities for the development of higher education. It is necessary to establish a new concept of education, organically integrating the missions of talent cultivation, educational development, and scientific and technological innovation, moving from the narrow logic of educational development to the broader logic of serving the construction of a modernized strong nation and promoting the development of global higher education. 



“We must fully leverage the synergistic advantages of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in terms of industry, science and education, finance, and international cooperation to accelerate the construction of regional technology transfer centers for universities across the country. We should gather the efforts from government, industry, academia, research, and finance to establish new mechanisms for the integrated development of scientific, technological and industrial innovation. We should actively support the Alliance for Open Life Sciences in launching the world-class scientific journals as initiating and participating in Mega Science programs. To meet the demands of the digital age, we must actively support universities in Hong Kong and Macao in strengthening their forward-looking layout in artificial intelligence and promoting the transformation of education empowered by artificial intelligence,” he added.



Minister Huai also stated that the construction of an education powerhouse is a systematic project. He hopes that universities in the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao will align with the goals and tasks of building a strong nation through education, work in tandem, and move forward together. It is essential to further leverage the unique role of Hong Kong and Macao to promote Hong Kong as an international education center as well as global innovation and talent hub. We must continue to strengthen cooperation and exchanges with world-class universities and successfully host the "World's Top Universities Forum."



Mr. Chan Kwok-Ki, Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government, said, "Hong Kong’s higher education sector has consistently leveraged its strengths to advance national educational development goals. Under the unique advantages under the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems', Hong Kong ranks among the world’s top five in overall education competitiveness and boasts five universities within the global top 100. In the coming decade, as China enters a golden era of rapid educational advancement, the HKSAR Government will steadfastly fulfill Hong Kong’s role as an international bridge and gateway. We will fully promote the internationalization and diversification of higher education, deepen collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland institutions, and foster future-leading talents and scientific elites—all contributing to building China into an education powerhouse and advancing national rejuvenation."



Lin Huiqing, President of the CAHE said, “The national blueprint for building China into an education powerhouse and its three-year action agenda are being comprehensively advanced and accelerated. Universities in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao constitute vital components of our self-reliant and high-calibre higher education system, serving as cornerstone forces in this national endeavour. Platforms such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao University Alliance have facilitated cross-regional faculty exchange, student mobility, and research resource sharing. Through concerted efforts between higher education institutions in Hong Kong/Macao and mainland research organizations, a series of internationally impactful achievements have been produced.”



She stated, “Accelerating the development of an education powerhouse represents both an honourable mission and historic responsibility jointly shouldered by universities across the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao. CAHE remains steadfast in aligning with national development priorities. We focus on advancing education powerhouse construction by leveraging our unique strengths as an academic society to deepen scholarly research, think tank development, international cooperation, educational governance, and public service. Looking ahead, CAHE will continue uniting member institutions and collaborating with universities throughout the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao to make new and greater contributions toward enhancing higher education cooperation and serving the national education powerhouse initiative.”



President Prof. Nancy IP of HKUST stated at the meeting, "HKUST is proud to serve as the host institution for this roundtable meeting and is excited to collaborate with top-tier universities and institutions from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao in establishing the Alliance of Open Life Sciences. As China advances its vision of becoming an education powerhouse, its universities must embrace a more prominent global role. Hong Kong’s academic institutions, with their internationally competitive research environment and innovative capacity, are uniquely positioned to drive this mission forward. HKUST sees this meeting as an opportunity to promote ongoing resource integration and institutional innovation among universities across the mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao, while strengthening international cooperation in education and research. We remain committed to advancing the national strategy of revitalizing China through science and education, positioning Hong Kong as an international higher education hub, and enhancing regional and global educational collaboration."

Three Core Themes, Five Key Directions: Building a Path to an Education Nation





The roundtable meeting explored how world-class universities can seize opportunities amid complex global dynamics, strengthen exchanges, and deepen open collaboration. Discussions centered on three themes: "Universities' Role in National Development," "The Greater Bay Area’s Contribution to an Education Nation," and "Hong Kong and Macao’s Responsibilities in Educational Advancement." Participants engaged in in-depth dialogues on interdisciplinary innovation, international research collaboration, open paradigms in life sciences, and preparations for a Global Summit of University Presidents.



The meeting emphasized the imperative of implementing national education strategies, establishing high-level academic platforms, and promoting mutual learning among global institutions. Mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao universities must synergize strategically, utilizing the Greater Bay Area platform and Hong Kong’s bridging role to advance internationalization. Key action areas include:

1.    Upholding moral education to cultivate next-generation talent for national rejuvenation.

2.    Enhancing resource integration to expand talent development pathways.

3.    Strengthening research collaboration to build innovation hubs.

4.    Driving digital transformation in education.

5.    Serving as a nexus for international cooperation.



To bolster partnerships, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, Xiamen University, and Sun Yat-sen University signed agreements with HKUST, CUHK, PolyU, CityU, HKU, and the University of Macau respectively, covering research, talent development, and academic exchanges. 



A key highlight was the signing of a carbon neutrality cooperation agreement between HKUST and Tsinghua University. The partnership will combine both institutions' research strengths in environmental science, renewable energy, advanced materials, and artificial intelligence to develop low-carbon technologies and accelerate green transformation.



Through this collaboration, the universities aim to advance multilateral cooperation on carbon neutrality and smart energy systems, helping achieve global carbon neutrality goals.





Launch of the Open Life Science Alliance





The meeting announced the establishment of the Alliance of Open Life Science by 15 institutions, accompanied by the release of the Global Openness and Collaboration in Life Sciences initiative and the launch of the Vita series of high-impact scientific journals. The Alliance will be chaired by Prof. Jin Li, President of Fudan University, with co-chairs Prof. Shi Yigong, President of Westlake University, and Prof. Nancy Ip, President of HKUST. A secretariat will be based at Fudan University, while HKUST will host a Hong Kong office to leverage the city’s "super-connector" role.



The Alliance will pool resources from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao to drive talent development, research innovation, and translational outcomes in life sciences, in partnership with global institutions. It calls on the international life science community to embrace UNESCO’s open science principles, fostering openness, collaboration, and synergy.



Moving forward, the Alliance will accelerate scientific and industrial innovation, build global networks, and create talent platforms to address global challenges and improve human health.

Dear all Engineering UG Students,





STEAMentors Leadership Training Program



 







 



Hong Kong Children in Need Foundation (HKCIN), a distinguished non-profit organization established in 2019, is committed to providing exceptional STEAM education opportunities to all students in Hong Kong on an equal footing. 



 



The "STEAMentors Leadership Training Program" is designed to shape Hong Kong's university students into well-rounded leaders in the STEAM field. 



 



Through 24 hours of immersive training in STEAM tools and teaching methods, such as Arduino, programming languages, creative teaching, and project planning, coupled with a 6-hour teaching internship, participants will be equipped to impart STEAM knowledge to local primary school students. By expanding young minds, igniting creativity, and instilling a sense of social responsibility, we aim to foster a positive outlook, enhance adaptability and persistence—traits highly valued by prospective employers.



 



Following the training, university students will have the opportunity to be remunerated for their teaching services in STEAM workshops and offer guidance to primary school children participating in various initiatives.



 



Key program details:



• Application deadline: September 19 (Friday) 11:59pm



• Face-to-face Interview dates: September 22 (Monday) to September 24 (Wednesday)



• Result announcement date: September 26 (Friday)

• Paid Internship Period: November 2025 – June 2026 (participate in group teaching for at least 3 workshops, with each workshop lasting around 2 to 3 hours)



• Medium of instruction: Cantonese (complemented by English teaching materials)

主题: Black Rainstorm Warning In Force
时间: 2025-08-14 08:41:36
发件人: allug-list-request@lists.ust.hk
--------------------正文--------------------

Dear Members of the University,



The Hong Kong Observatory has issued a Black Rainstorm Warning Signal at 7:50 am this morning. Because of potential flooding and inclement weather conditions, people are advised to take shelter in a safe place and stay there. They should not attempt to travel until the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is no longer in force and traffic conditions have improved.  



 



According to the Tropical Cyclone and Rainstorm Warning Arrangement circular No. 1/2025 issued by CMO <https://cmo.ust.hk/severe-weather-information> , while a Black Rainstorm Warning is in effect, staff and students should stay indoor or take shelter in a safe place. Staff should report for duty as soon as the Warning is cancelled, if weather and transport conditions permit.  The University's top priority is staff safety.  Staff having genuine difficulties in returning to office should explain to their immediate supervisor immediately and seek approval for alternative work arrangements.



As a general rule, if the warning is cancelled at or after 12 noon on weekdays (OR at or after 8 am on Saturdays for those who are required to work on Saturday morning; OR at or after 12 noon for those who are required to work whole day on Saturday), Department Heads have the discretion to arrange staff to work from home subject to meeting operational requirements.  Staff who are on shift duties should report to work two hours after the above warning is cancelled.  According to the ARO webpage <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/bad-weather-arrangement-case-typhoon-or-rainstorm-class> , When a Black Rainstorm Warning is in force, all (including online) classes and examinations will be canceled.  Those in progress will normally continue until the end. 



For faculty with teaching duty, please follow Arrangement for Class / Exam under weather warning signals: Bad weather arrangement - In Case of Typhoon or Rainstorm (Class) | HKUST - Academic Registry <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/bad-weather-arrangement-case-typhoon-or-rainstorm-class>  and Bad weather arrangement - In case of Typhoon or Rainstorm (Final Exam) | HKUST - Academic Registry <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/bad-weather-arrangement-case-typhoon-or-rainstorm-finalexam>  respectively.



Please follow these instructions and refer to the webpages for more details.



Take care and stay safe,



Health, Safety and Environment Office

Duration: From 12:10 pm to 1:10 pm (service will run for ONE HOUR ONLY).









Frequency: Buses will run approximately every 5-10 minutes.

主题: A confirmed Chikungunya Fever case and stepping up of campus mosquito control

发件人: allug-list-request@lists.ust.hk
--------------------正文--------------------

Dear Members of the University,



 



We were notified by the Government Centre for Health Protection (CHP) this morning that one of our students living on campus is a confirmed case of Chikungunya Fever 基孔肯雅熱. The patient recently traveled outside of Hong Kong and therefore is likely an imported case.



 



Chikungunya Fever is caused by a virus, and is transmitted by mosquito only. The disease is self-limiting, meaning most people recover by themselves after suffering the symptoms of fever and joint pain for a period of time. There is currently no special treatment other than controlling the symptoms, and there is no vaccine either. CMO has been stepping up mosquito control in the past weeks following Government advice, and they will now further improve environmental hygiene to reduce mosquito population. Members are also reminded to protect themselves well against mosquito bites and prevent mosquito proliferation in their living environment.



 



For more details about the disease and preventive measures, please refer to this CHP webpage https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/6122.html <https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/6122.html>

Dear Students, 



 



We are thrilled to invite you to participate in the "GenAI Hackathon for the SDGs," an innovative event jointly organized by all eight universities in Hong Kong! 



 



Running from 20th September to 1st November, this unique hackathon offers an exciting opportunity to utilize Generative AI (GenAI) to address global challenges in education, innovation, and sustainability. Unlike typical short-term hackathons, this extended event allows ample time to think creatively, develop new skills, and engage in meaningful collaboration with peers across Hong Kong. 



 



Please mark your calendars: the hackathon kicks off with a Team-Forming Day on 20th September and concludes with a Pitch Day on 1st November. Participants are expected to attend both of these key events in person. 



 



Throughout the hackathon, you'll have numerous opportunities to network with fellow innovators, attend insightful workshops on sustainability, innovation, and GenAI technologies, and compete for exciting prizes. 



 



Choose from four impactful thematic tracks: 



1.	Youth Empowerment and Inclusion 



2.	Social Resilience and Adaptation 



3.	Sustainable Design and Biodiversity 



4.	Artistic and Cultural Innovation 



 



This hackathon is not only a chance to win awards but also a platform for driving meaningful change and launching your entrepreneurial journey. 



 



Spots are limited, so we encourage you to register before 15th September. Remember, all team members must register individually. 



 



For more information and to sign up, please visit: https://www.hack4sdg.com <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hack4sdg.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cxlilv%40connect.ust.hk%7Ce96b331c89fe4d52955008dddede8846%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638911769569488599%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=G6NqwPWox%2F4300QMbnZ2beh1ep24%2F4H6fEYM8TFLhiM%3D&reserved=0>

Prof. CHEN Kani from the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics at HKUST (front row, middle) and his PhD student in Mathematics Mr. YANG Haowei (back row), have led the development of "Aivilization", the largest-scale AI multi-agent social simulation sandbox to date. Maths PhD student Mr. Ricky CHAN (front row, right) and computer science Mphil student Miss CHEN Xingyan (front row, left) are members of the research team.



	



The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) today announced the launch of “Aivilization”, the largest-scale AI multi-agent social simulation sandbox to date. This innovative platform studies how human interaction with AI can shape a virtual society, where ‘AI inhabitants’ can organically develop their own governance structures, economies and cultural norms.  



As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, understanding the dynamics of communication between humans and artificial intelligence has become a crucial area of study. Previous simulation models like Project Sid1 and Stanford Smallville2 have explored similar themes, with community sizes of around 1,000 and dozens of AI agents respectively, to observe the evolution of AI civilizations.



Aivilization significantly expands on these efforts by combining interactive gameplay, large-scale public participation and real-time AI experimentation, involving 100,000 AI agents over a six-week period. Unlike traditional AI sandbox environments, which often face high operational costs and static evaluation frameworks, Aivilization introduces groundbreaking advancements that enhance the platform's performance and enable more in-depth studies of human-AI interactions. Key innovations include:



*	An AI society Mimicking the Real World: The AI characters of this platform exhibit more complex behaviors and near-human capabilities in areas such as production, free trade, socializing, career planning, and lifestyle management, allowing them to generate their own culture and society. 

*	Lower cost and Scalable Public Participation: Unlike previous AI civilization simulations that operated as single-instance, offline models with simpler character architectures, Aivilization functions on a real-time massive multiplayer online (MMO) system with industrial-grade character framework system. Together with autonomous model scaling, the operational cost of each AI character is just US$2 per month — a reduction of over 95% compared to other sandbox platforms - greatly increasing the scale of public participation. 

*	Dynamic Human-AI Synergy: Players can engage in more meaningful interactions with their AI characters by selecting an MBTI type for them and influence their ‘thoughts and lives’ through prompts. Players can adjust their communication tactics during character development, offering advice and guidance on study paths, job hunting and relationships. 

*	Evaluation for players and AI characters: The platform uniquely analyzes both the social and career developments of AI characters and the effectiveness of players’ communication with them. It also provides guidance to help players enhance their interactions with AI.





Bridging the AI Literacy Gap Through Gaming





Designed to transform AI literacy education into an engaging, hands-on gaming experience where users can create, train, and collaborate with AI agents in a dynamic virtual environment, Avilization is now accessible for global participation at https://www.aivilization.ai/ <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aivilization.ai%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cmeganchick%40ust.hk%7C4a7e6f3253574ee40dae08dddefab810%7Cc917f3e2932249269bb3daca730413ca%7C1%7C0%7C638911890608119751%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NC0hfCWUDEWu9HBCEIpl1eipyoToScHyKwvytYhMlnk%3D&reserved=0> . Complimentary access is available to students, researchers, educators, professionals from the higher education sector, AI enterprises, and the gaming industry on a first-come-first served basis. Participants will engage in a six-week experiment from August to October to observe emergent behaviors in human-AI collaboration, and will receive a “life report” detailing their characters’ development across five aspects: fortune, work achievements, life satisfaction, skills and knowledge, and social relationships upon completion. Players will also receive analysis on the effectiveness of their communications with AI characters. 



Prof. CHEN Kani from the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics at HKUST, who led the development of this platform, said, “Empowering individuals with AI literacy is foundational to navigating and shaping the future. At HKUST, we have always championed this vision, leading the way in interdisciplinary AI education that equips users with precision-driven command execution and prompt engineering skills. By cultivating these competencies, we are not simply preparing for tomorrow’s challenges but actively shaping the vision of a human-centric AI future.” 



Mr. YANG Haowei, a PhD student of Prof. Chen in Mathematics who contributed to the platform’s development, added, “Users are able to refine commands that yield accurate AI responses, with built-in tutorials from basic syntax to advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting. Whether you are a student, entrepreneur, or curious parent, this game teaches you to communicate effectively with AI, transforming vague ideas into actionable prompts that get tangible results.” 





Global Accessibility and Unlimited Potential





The team has founded Bauhinia AI, an HKUST-incubated start-up dedicated to transforming cutting-edge AI research into global commercial applications in gaming, digital economy, social simulation and market research. 



HKUST has always been at the forefront of AI education, taking pioneering steps as the first university in Hong Kong to adopt generative AI in response to its growing prominence. In May 2025, the HKUST Von Neumann Institute launched the Artificial Intelligence School Education Program to promote AI knowledge and awareness among local secondary school students.

Date: 15 August 2025



 



Dear Student Housing and Residential Life Office,



 



I am explaining the address discrepancy related to my HKDSE Certificate. The Hong Kong local address shown on the certificate is my uncle’s residence, which was used solely for receiving official correspondence during the exam process.



 



I obtained Hong Kong identity as a dependant of my mother. I have been residing at Room 404, No. 6, Lane 601, Guoding Road, Yangpu District, Shanghai all this time and had been studying here before getting the identity. Using my uncle’s Hong Kong address was just a practical arrangement for mail - receiving needs regarding the HKDSE, as my actual long - term living place has been and remains this Shanghai address.



 



I would like to consult about what documentary proof is needed for my situation? Because it seems not to comply with the requirements in your "document required".



 



Best regards,



 



李雪阳 LI XUEYANG

HKUST selects eight cutting-edge projects for the latest round of Sustainable Smart Campus as a Living Lab program for testing on campus. 



	



The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) selected eight cutting-edge projects for the latest round of Sustainable Smart Campus as a Living Lab program for testing on campus. Covering a wide range of sustainability challenges on campus, the projects address energy efficiency, renewable energy optimization, water management, wellness, ecosystem enhancement, and predictive maintenance strategies, providing students and faculty with hands-on experience with prototypes before real-world implementation.



With a total funding allocation of HK$3.3 million, these eight project teams - representing scientists and staff from eight different departments - will transform various areas of the campus starting later this year. The Living Labs program emphasizes real-world impact, accelerating sustainability research by faculty, students, and alumni to support HKUST’s 2028 Sustainability Challenge <https://sust.hkust.edu.hk/2028-sustainability-challenge>  and Net-Zero Action Plan 2045 <https://sust.hkust.edu.hk/netzeroactionplan> , while turning the Clear Water Bay campus into a vibrant testbed for practical new innovations. Projects are selected through a rigorous selection process that incorporates feedback from panels of industry leaders and campus operations experts.



 “Year after year, our Living Lab project teams find novel ways to apply their expertise to address our critical sustainability challenges,” says Prof. TAM Kar-Yan, HKUST Vice-President for Administration and Business. “Ranging from biodiversity to robotics, this year’s projects represent a new benchmark in the breadth of proposals from our community to tackle a myriad of sustainability issues our society faces. We look forward to nurturing these vital projects from lab concepts into high-impact applications, paving the way for accelerated adoption in Hong Kong and beyond.” 



Dr. Kenneth LEUNG, Director of Sustainability/Net-Zero of HKUST, added, “The Living Lab concept we have developed over the years has transformed our campus. This initiative has not only accelerated research and development but also fostered collaboration across our university community. Through this approach, students, faculty, and campus operations staff can seamlessly connect to implement innovative solutions together. This collaborative model now extends beyond our campus, bridging early-stage startups (such as those at HKSTP) with HKUST scientists for joint research - with the long-term goal of expanding into commercial applications in the near future." 



The eight 2025 Living Labs projects are:

About the Sustainable Smart Campus as a Living Lab Program





Launched in 2019, the Living Lab program, co-led by the HKUST Sustainability/Net-Zero Office and the GREAT Smart Cities Institute, has pioneered a novel approach of testing ideas across HKUST campus. Students and faculty are encouraged to submit project proposals, with selected initiatives receiving funding for implementation within campus operations. This allows researchers to refine ideas, assess real-world impact, and explore scaling the initiatives to the wider community. 



With a focus on enhancing campus operations, the projects are part of a broader effort to fulfill HKUST’s 2028 Sustainability Challenge <https://sust.hkust.edu.hk/about/2028challenge/progress-performance>  and Net-Zero Action Plan 2045 <https://sust.hkust.edu.hk/netzeroactionplan> , which includes targets concerning energy, water, landfill waste, and community well-being.  Today, the Living Lab program is financed by funds generated from the Feed-in-Tariff Scheme. Since 2023, the program has matched early-stage startups with HKUST scientists to conduct joint research.

Dear Students,



 



The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) is now accepting applications for Fall 2025-26. Schedule for UROP Fall 2025-26 can be found here <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/schedule> .



 



Course Types:



*   The Series Stream (UROP1100/2100/3100/4100) is a 1-credit course and a prerequisite of P* (Pass to Proceed) grade is required for students to continue the course series at a higher level under the same project, e.g., receiving P* in UROP1100 in order to enroll in UROP2100.



*   The 1-credit UROP3200 course (Undergraduate Research Opportunities with Mini-conference Experience) is now offered as a Common Core UxOP Course. For more details of UROP3200, please refer to the webpage HERE <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/urop3200_projects> . 



(Note: The on-campus Mini-conference for Fall 2025-26 is tentatively scheduled to be held in the afternoon of 1 December 2025 (Monday). Students should reserve your time for the event.)



 



Eligibility Requirements:



*   First-time UROP participant is required to have enrolled in a full-time degree-bearing program for at least two semesters at HKUST and attained a minimum CGA of 3.30 for UROP1100. For students who have completed UROP1000 before, this requirement can be waived.



*   UROP participants are expected to fulfil the CGA requirement of 3.0 (for UROP1000) or 3.3 (for UROP1100). To allow more students with research potentials to join UROP, effective from Summer 2023-24, supervisors are allowed to provide strong justification with substantial grounds to support applications from students who fail to meet the CGA requirements but demonstrate research competencies. Such justification should include:



*	Student’s achievement of related awards, contests and/or other activities 

*	Student’s previous research experience and/or research skills 

*	Student’s academic performance in related course(s) and/or coursework



Students should submit a study plan in which they specify how they will manage their projects throughout the semester. The UROP Office reserves the right of final decision on the eligibility of any students under exceptional consideration.



 



*   For UROP 3200, a prerequisite of TWO passing grades in TWO UROP1100 courses OR TWO passing grades in UROP1100 and UROP2100 is required. 



*   Students are advised to discuss with the project supervisors on how the project will be conducted. 



 



Application Procedures:



For UROP1100/2100/3100/3200/4100



*   Visit the Courses <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/courses>  and Information for Students <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/For_Students>  pages for details.



*   For the usage details of the Online System, please check out the UROP Online Student Application System Guidebook <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/guidelines/UROP%20System%20-%20Guideline%20for%20Student.pdf> .



*   Browse the UROP Project Listing <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/projects>  to find your interested project(s) and contact the corresponding supervisors for consent.



*   Apply through the UROP Online System <http://uropos.ust.hk/>  by uploading the required documents.



*   Deadline: 3 September 2025 (Wednesday)



*   Students who wish to seek special consideration must submit their applications, study plans and supervisors’ supporting letters one week before the deadline above, i.e., 27 August 2025 (Wednesday).  Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.  



 



Important Notes:



*   Each student can only submit ONE online application for each semester. You are recommended to contact and consult the project supervisor of your interested project(s) prior to submitting an online application or if you would like to propose new project topics.



*   For UROP students of Summer 2024-25 who wish to continue the UROP series (i.e., UROP2100/3100/4100) in Fall 2025-26: the UROP report and a P* (Pass to Proceed) grade must be received and checked by the UROP Office BEFORE you submit an online application.



 



Additional Course Completion Requirement:



*   Effective from Spring 2022-23, apart from the submission of a final report, all UROP students are required to complete an online training of “Responsible Conduct of Research” (RCR). The training aims to equip students with knowledge of good practices on conducting research. 



*   You are required to watch all the lecture videos and complete the quizzes of all 10 required and supplemental modules (if any, as project supervisors may require their students to complete supplemental modules based on their project nature), within one month after the end of the add/drop period, 13 October 2025 (Monday), at the latest.



*   Please submit the completion report to the UROP Office via email at urop@ust.hk <mailto:urop@ust.hk>  for checking by 20 October 2025 (Monday).



*   To complete the RCR training, students should complete the quiz (3-5 MC questions) at the end of each required (and supplemental) module and obtain at least 80% for each. Quizzes can be re-attempted as many times as needed until the requirement is met. Students who fail the RCR training course will receive a Fail grade in the UROP course. 



*   UROP students who have taken the training and obtained a Pass in each required module in previous semester do NOT need to do the training and submit the report again.



*   Please refer to the guidelines HERE <https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/For_Students>  for more information on the training.

If you have an adequate Python programming background, you are welcome to take this Python Proficiency Test. Upon passing the test, you will be waived the pre-requisite of COMP2011 (“Programming with C++”) and COMP2211 (“Exploring Artificial Intelligence”). This waiver allows you to directly register COMP2011 and/or COMP2211 without having to take their pre-requisite.  



 



The Python Proficiency Test will be held on-site (face-to-face) and will extensively cover both programming basics (e.g., control flow, collections, functions, recursion, OOP) and data manipulation libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib). 



 



*** Passing this test is only for waiving the pre-requisite. It will NOT guarantee your enrollment into COMP2011 or COMP2211. Whether you can successfully enroll in the course depends on the capacities and the waitlists of the lecture and lab sections. ***



 



*** This is not a credit-bearing test. Passing this test will NOT grant you 3 credits for the fundamental programming course. ***



 



Who should take the test:



  - Those students who are competent in fundamental programming in Python and want to waive the pre-requisite of COMP2011 and COMP2211. 



 



*** Those who are currently taking or have taken COMP1023 are NOT eligible to take this test.  (Please see FAQ1 for more details regarding the pre-requisites of COMP2011 and COMP2211.) ***



 



Test format: Written, closed-book test including T/F, code comprehension, and code writing questions.



Duration: 1 Hour 30 minutes



Date/Time:       2nd September, 2025 (Tuesday), 8 pm



Venue: On campus (exact venue to be announced).        



 



Please click on the link below and register for the test before the deadline: 11:59pm 31-August-2025 (Sunday).

2.	Data manipulation libraries, which include NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.



For the details, please refer to the course materials of “COMP1023 – Introduction to Python Programming <https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp1023/proficiency-test/> ”. You can access the course web without authentication within the HKUST campus (You may also access the course webpage without authentication by using the HKUST VPN <https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/cyber-security/vpn>  connection).



  



Passing Criteria



To pass the test, you must demonstrate competence in both Area 1 (basic programming concepts) and Area 2 (data manipulation libraries). 



 



Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):



1.            What are the pre-requisites of COMP2011 and COMP2211?



For this Fall semester, the pre-requisite of COMP2011 is COMP1021 / COMP1022P / ISOM3230, and the pre-requisite of COMP2211 is COMP1021 / COMP1029P.



Starting from Spring 2026, the pre-requisite of both COMP2011 and COMP2211 is COMP1023. For those who have taken COMP1021, you will need to either pass the Python Proficiency Test or have taken another Python Bridging course to waive the pre-requisite of COMP2011 or COMP2211.



 



2.            Can this test substitute COMP1023?



No. The test is solely for “requisite waiver” for COMP2011 and COMP2211.  Passing the test neither earns any academic credit nor is considered as equivalent to passing the pre-requisite courses of COMP2011 and COMP2211.



 



3.            After passing the test and taking COMP2011 and/or COMP2211, can I take COMP1021 / COMP1022P / COMP1023?



No.  



Please note that quite a few programs in HKUST require ONE of the COMP programming courses, such as COMP1021 / COMP1023. If you enroll in one of those programs, make sure you discuss with your program coordinator what you should do to satisfy the above programming course requirement. Most likely, you will be required to file a curriculum deviation to substitute the COMP1021 / COMP1023 course with COMP2011 or other course(s) approved by your program coordinator. Please also be reminded to make-up the 3 credits to fulfill the graduation requirement (https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/graduation-requirements-ug <https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/graduation-requirements-ug> ). 



 



For students enrolled in BEng(COMP), BEng(CPEG), BEng(AI) and BSc(COSC), also notice that if you plan to take COMP2011, you will not be able to take COMP2012H afterwards, but COMP2012 to fulfill the major requirement.



 



(For details of curriculum deviation, see https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/deviation-curriculum-ug )



 



4.            How long is the result of the test valid for?



The result is valid for registering COMP2011 or COMP2211 within 1 year.  



 



5.            After passing the test, can I take COMP2012H?



No. This test is only for waiving the pre-requisite of COMP2011 and COMP2211. If you would like to enroll in COMP2012H, you will need to separately submit a “requisite waiver”, and it is subject to the approval of COMP2012H’s instructor.



 



6.            After I have taken COMP1023 but failed, can I use the test to waive the pre-requisite of COMP2011 or COMP2211 pre-requisite requirement?



No.  If you have taken COMP1023, you are not allowed to take the test. Also, when you register for COMP2011 or COMP2211, you must not have taken COMP1023 before.

Living here will give you the chance to make new friends, communicate with different people, learn from each other, and develop all aspects of your life. Please try to join the activities organized by the Hall Education team at different times.



 



But, with the freedom and fun of hall life comes responsibility and hall regulations. Remember,



 



Be Inclusive: Embrace the diversity of our community.



Be Respectful: Treat everyone with courtesy and respect.



Be Considerate: Stop making noise during quiet hours to ensure a peaceful environment for all.



Stay Healthy: No-smoking is allowed in the whole campus and no-alcohol is allowed in all halls.

*NO requests for early check-in or late check-out will be entertained.



 



 



I.                   Eligibility



Hall offer becomes null and void once you cease to be a full-time registered student or become ineligible for student housing. It is your responsibility to inform the Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO) in writing INSTANTLY in case you are no longer eligible for student housing and vacate the student accommodation immediately. Please refer to Eligibility for Student Accommodation <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/admission-policy/ug/eligibility-for-student-accommodation>  for details.



 



 



II.                Hall and Room Allocation



Hall and Room Allocation are made by considering residents’ preferences (indicated in the hall applications), subject to availability. There is NO GUARANTEE of a particular assignment to any student hall, room type or with a specific roommate while Residence Masters have maintained that no change of hall will be accepted to promote a sense of belonging. Please refer to Can I choose my hall/room <https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/apply-for-housing/ug/can-i-choose-my-hall-room-new-local-ugs-non-local-ugs-continuing-ugs>  for details about Hall and Room Allocations, and Official Hall/ Room Swapping.   



 



 



III.             Payment of Hall Charges

2.

Paid hall fees will NOT be refunded under such circumstances.



 



Meanwhile, a fixed penalty of HK$100 per person per night plus hall charges incurred on a daily basis will be levied on those who fail to check out by the given deadline.



 



 



V.                Important Rules and Penalties



Students must note that trading or private transfer of hall place is strictly forbidden. All discovery/reports of violation of rules will be investigated and penalties (e.g., recovery of the hall place offered, forfeiture of hall charges paid, disqualification of future hall application, further disciplinary action) will be levied on the student(s) involved.

Dear Students,



 



Please note that the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is offering COMP 2633 - Competitive Programming in Cybersecurity I, a course designed for those interested in learning cyber-threats and competing in CTF challenges. For full details, please see the forwarded message below.



 



Best regards,



E2I



 



*********message forwarded from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering*********



 



 



Dear students, 



 



Do you know that Cyberattacks happen far more frequently than you thought? Do you know that over 80% of the 500 biggest companies in the world have experienced Cyberattacks? Even the luxurious brand, LVMH, is of no exception and suffered from a major Cyberattack in the past July. Do you know that Cyber-attacks have cost the world 9,500,000,000,000 USD (i.e., 9.5 trillion USD) in 2024?



 



Even some of today’s most secure computer systems could be vulnerable to malicious attacks. In fact, any equipment with a processing unit is susceptible to Cyberattacks.  Do you want to learn how vulnerable the systems are? Do you want to meet cybersecurity enthusiasts and learn about cyber-threats with some of the most knowledgeable senior students of your age? Do you want a course that would train you to deal with system vulnerabilities and apply your skills in local and global cybersecurity competitions? The chance to mingle and cooperate with knowledgeable students and compete alongside them? If the answers to the above questions are positive, then our course  



 



 



COMP 2633 - Competitive Programming in Cybersecurity I 



 



could be the dream course for you! Many of the talented students joining the course in the previous semesters have won prizes in various cybersecurity competitions, and you could talk to these talented people directly through the course! They will help train you! If you are talented and independent enough, together with them, you too could win prizes in various competitions!  This course COMP2633 is probably one of the few courses that would give you the chance to know how real-world hackers would hack the systems! 



 



To stay legal, we will not really hack in the course. But if you join the course, you will learn hacking skills through CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. These challenges usually mimic real-world scenarios, and if you could solve those challenges, it usually indicates you have the knowledge and ability to do what a hacker could do. The knowledge and ability, together with other skills, could help you build secure computer systems that would become a pain to attack!  To have a taste of CTF challenges, we have created a "playground" for you to try some “baby” level questions: 



 





https://intro.firebird.sh/ <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fintro.firebird.sh%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cxlilv%40connect.ust.hk%7C8b0f046183db4467777208dde1145dbc%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638914199837205384%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mto9ZpF0wCzbPr5RKeVltSDm7nGBwAnHD0qnT8AMU9U%3D&reserved=0>  



 



Please take a look! You can access the challenges at the bottom by clicking the “Try some CTF challenges” button. If you find some of these challenges to be a bit overwhelming, it is normal! Perhaps you should consider joining the first class of COMP2633 on 5th September to learn more.  



 



If you find these challenges to be interesting and even easy for you, then you should definitely consider joining the first class of COMP2633! Together with our seasoned Firebird cybersecurity team members, you could be another award-winning team member!  



 



In the above “playground”, there is also a “Youtube” video prepared by the CTF community explaining the idea of CTF. Feel free to take a look if you want to know more about CTF in general. 



 



If you are still hesitating about whether you should really join the course, perhaps the painkilling decision is just to join the first class of COMP2633! The first class will happen on Friday, 5th September, at 6 pm. Its ZOOM link is at: 



 



https://hkust.zoom.us/j/96272026341?pwd=wD8RsZmfJjPIGwGROPDNsNQNmrB21I.1



 



This class is likely to provide you with all the detailed information for making the decision whether to enroll or not (grade calculation, skill sets involved, etc). We will also start our first set of training in the first class to let you know what the remaining classes are like. Remember our course DOES NOT COME WITH ANY PREREQUISITE, you will absolutely lose nothing by joining the first class, and it is online anyway.  



 



If you have questions, feel free to send an email to us at firebird@cse.ust.hk <mailto:firebird@cse.ust.hk>  (do not reply directly to the sender of this email). We hope you will grasp this valuable opportunity and get involved if you also have a keen passion for the practical aspects of the Cybersecurity field!  



 



Best regards, 



Dr. Alex Lam of the Department of CSE, and the Firebird CTF Team

Dear students, 



 



Join us for a series of experiential-learning courses where student-consultants apply technology and management (T&M) strategies to solve complex problems faced by an industry-leading firm. The health insurance sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, driven by rising consumer expectations, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Bowtie was established to address the significant protection gap in the market and has since experienced rapid growth, attracting substantial investment and continuously expanding its offerings.



 



Under the guidance of the teaching team, you will apply McKinsey consulting engagement principles to create a 3-year product roadmap to enhance domestic growth, and two countries of choice to decide on an international expansion strategy. Interested students must request instructor consent and attach their latest transcript and CV starting today, 22 August. Attendance of the first TEMG4950P class meeting on Thursday Sep 4, 2025 (Thursday), 6:00pm in room 6580 is MANDATORY for student selection.

Dear Engineering Students,



 



"How to be successful in life? And what does it even mean?"



"What career do you want to pursue after graduation?"



"What matter in your university life besides CGA?" 



 



There are no one-size-fits-all answers to these big questions and no one else can answer them for you. If you have not yet discovered your own answers, the "Design Your Life" course is exactly what you need.

Dear all Engineering UG Students,



 



Are you looking for a place where you can transform lectures knowledge into working robots, a place you can have hands-on experience in full-cycle machine production, or a place you can immerse yourself in a vibrant tech atmosphere with a community of like-minded enthusiasts?



 



Come and join RoboMaster Team ENTERPRIZE!



 







 



Introduction to RoboMaster and ENTERPRIZE



RoboMaster is the world's first intelligent shooting robot competition organised by DJI. In the competition, red and blue teams each field seven robots with different functionalities and engage in tactical combat using first-person shooter (FPS) gameplay on a MOBA-style tower defence map.



HKUST RoboMaster team ENTERPRIZE represents the university in the RoboMaster University Series every year. We have won international regional championships and RoboMaster University League branch championships in past years. Since the establishment ten years ago, the team has accumulated a wealth of technical expertise and fostered a strong technical atmosphere.



What do we do at ENTERPRIZE?



Constructing a robot is an interdisciplinary project that requires the collaborative efforts of developers from multiple technical departments. In our team, we are divided into the following four technical departments, each of which plays a crucial role in the manufacturing and development process of the robot. Choose one to join based on your interests or expertise!



The Mechanical Department is responsible for designing robot blueprints using the 3D modelling software SolidWorks, then processing parts via 3D printing or CNC machine tools, and finally assembling the robot structure to complete the transition from blueprint to reality. During the mid-to-late stages of the season, the Mechanical Department iterates on the blueprints and performs regular maintenance and repairs based on the issues and requirements encountered when the Software and Algorithm Departments test the robot.



The Hardware Department is responsible for designing and drawing PCB circuit boards, selecting and soldering appropriate electronic components, and finally connecting the circuits on the robot. During the subsequent testing process by the Software and Algorithm Departments, the hardware design is iterated based on the stability issues and performance requirements encountered by the system, and regular maintenance and troubleshooting work is also carried out.



The Software Department is responsible for implementing serial communication and motion control to build a system of various modules on the robot by writing C++ programs on the STM32 microcontroller. Tasks such as controlling motors and other motion actuators to achieve flexible robot movement, or ensuring that bullets are fired at a stable speed are important jobs of Software Department. During the subsequent testing process conducted by the Algorithm Department, the program and parameters will be optimized and adjusted by the Software Department according to the requirements for control accuracy and response speed.



The Algorithm Department needs to process information collected by sensors such as cameras and lidar to let the robots perceive the surroundings, as if equipping the robots with 'vision' or 'perception', and thus automatically or semi-automatically complete various tasks on the battlefield. This allows the robots to strike opponents and activate buffs more quickly and accurately than when controlled manually by operators, and thereby gains an advantage on the battlefield for the team.

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) today received plaques from YIN Hejun, Minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for its three State Key Laboratories (SKLs) at the Government Headquarters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). HKUST sincerely thanks MOST, and the Hong Kong Innovation, Technology, and Industry Bureau (ITIB) for their continued trust and recognition of the University’s research efforts. In addition to the two renamed SKLs following restructuring – the “State Key Laboratory of Nervous System Disorders (SKLNSD)” and the “State Key Laboratory of Displays and Opto-Electronics (SKLDOE)” – HKUST will also collaborate with The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) to establish a new “State Key Laboratory of Climate Resilience for Coastal Cities (SKLCRCC)”. The new lab aims to provide scientific and technological support to address national priorities such as coping with extreme weather and enhancing urban safety and disaster prevention capabilities.



MOST initiated the optimization and restructuring of SKLs in 2022 and approved the restructuring for 12 existing labs in early 2025, along with the establishment of three new ones (one of which is jointly built by two universities). All 15 SKLs officially became national-level scientific and technological innovation platforms on July 1 this year. HKUST has both fully retained all its existing SKLs and successfully obtained approval to establish a new one. 



Chief Executive John LEE of HKSAR, Minister Yin Hejun of MOST, Director ZHOU Ji of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR (LOCPG), and Secretary SUN Dong of the ITIB attended today’s plaque presentation ceremony and held a forum with the presidents of five local universities and the directors of the 15 SKLs. They discussed how Hong Kong can leverage its talented professionals, innovative research, and international environment to better support the nation’s innovation-driven development strategy.  Prof. Nancy IP, HKUST President and Director of the SKLNSD, Prof. Kristiaan NEYTS, Director of SKLDOE, Prof. FAN Zhiyong, Co-Director of the SKLDOE, and Prof. Charles NG, Co-Director of SKLCRCC, for this discussion and the subsequent plaque-awarding ceremony.



HKSAR Chief Executive John Lee stated, "Under the principle of 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world and actively plays the role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. The SKLs in Hong Kong serve as an important platform for bringing together outstanding researchers from all over the world by establishing partnerships with top universities and research institutions at home and abroad, helping to build Hong Kong into a hub for international high-end talent."



MOST Minister Yin Hejun said that the establishment of 15 State Key Laboratories in Hong Kong reflects the nation's high recognition and full confidence in Hong Kong's scientific research capabilities, innovation capacity and development potential. It also represents the Central Government's ardent expectations and momentous mission for Hong Kong's scientific community. He hopes these laboratories will further strengthen their commitment to addressing the scientific challenges underlying national needs, and dare to explore uncharted territories at the frontiers of science and technology.



LOCPG Director Zhou Ji stated that a number of internationally renowned scholars and scientists have become new Hong Kong residents in recent years. He anticipates Hong Kong to better leverage its unique advantages by vigorously promoting the holistic development of education, science, and talent cultivation, and to attract and nurture more world-class talents and innovative teams through high-caliber research platforms and collaborative initiatives.



ITIB Secretary Prof. Sun Dong stated: "The HKSAR Government initiated the restructuring exercise of the State Key Laboratories in Hong Kong in late 2023, and MOST approved the restructuring of 15 SKLs in Hong Kong in January 2025. We hope the SKLs will closely align with the country’s major strategic needs, focus on the global technology frontier, and significantly enhance research and development standards. We also hope that they will fully leverage Hong Kong’s advantages as an international city to actively expand global research collaborations, and cultivate and attract top talent from around the world, thus contributing to the technological self-reliance of the country and the development of Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology centre.”



HKUST President Prof. Nancy Ip stated: “HKUST sincerely thanks the Central Government, MOST and the ITIB for their great trust and endorsement. The University has not only completed the restructuring of its existing State Key Laboratories but has also been granted approval to establish a new one — a strong recognition of HKUST’s research strength. The restructured system offers clearer strategic positioning and a more systematic and comprehensive overall framework. The extension of the State Key Laboratory program and the National Engineering Research Centers to Hong Kong has significantly enhanced collaborative innovation between scientists from the mainland and Hong Kong. This enables Hong Kong to better leverage its distinctive advantages in research and international connectivity to serve national strategic priorities, while also providing a broader platform for its integration into the nation’s science and technology development. HKUST will continue to align with national strategic needs, commit to pioneering scientific research and breakthroughs in core technologies, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, attract top-tier talent globally, and contribute meaningfully to building China into a leading science and technology powerhouse and elevating Hong Kong’s role as an international innovation and technology hub.”



According to arrangements by the Innovation and Technology Commission, each laboratory will receive regular funding support, and the university will provide corresponding matching resources to a sustained focus on national priorities and the execution of long-term, strategic research missions. Each laboratory has developed clear development plans, performance targets and standardized operational and management mechanisms.

Dear LI, Xueyang (21308259),

The charge will be due on 4 September 2025.



Payment procedures are detailed at https://fo.hkust.edu.hk/files/fo-files/StudentPayment.pdf <https://fo.hkust.edu.hk/files/fo-files/StudentPayment.pdf>  and https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/CSFU/Guidelines%20for%20new%20payment%20method%20(WeChatPay_Alipay_FPS).pdf <https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/CSFU/Guidelines%20for%20new%20payment%20method%20(WeChatPay_Alipay_FPS).pdf> . It will take a few working days for processing and receiving your payment before records are updated on SIS; please arrange your payment early.

主题: [MATH1013] Choosing the appropriate calculus course
时间: 2025-08-26 00:02:15
发件人: owner-math1013-l09-fall@lists.ust.hk
--------------------正文--------------------

Dear students,

 

 

You are receiving this message because you have been pre-enrolled in the course MATH1013 (Calculus I) this coming Fall term.  I have already received a number of enquiries from you regarding how to decide on the appropriate first-year calculus course.  If you have similar concerns, please refer to the "important message" posted on our Canvas website:

https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/66058

 

Here is a rough guideline for choosing the calculus course that is suitable for you:

https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/66058/pages/deciding-among-different-calculus-courses

Please note that since there are some new arrangements about first-year calculus courses starting from this year, some "academic advice" that you may find online for past cohorts may no longer be valid now.  Please discuss with your academic advisor about your own program requirements.  You're also welcome to discuss with me or the course instructor of your section; we'll try to help as much as we can.

 

 

Best regards,

Henry Cheng

Coordinator of MATH1013

Cybersecurity Learning Series – 



 



Why you need to protect your privacy when using free Wi-fi



 



*       Connecting to public networks opens up your phone to hackers and viruses



*       What should you do to keep your data safe if you really want to finish your YouTube video but have run out of mobile data?



 







 



How to secure your device if you really have to use public Wi-fi hotspots



 



*       Enable firewalls and antivirus software on your devices.



*       Never download or install anything while using public Wi-fi – wait until you get home.



*       Don’t input any personal information to register for public Wi-fi. If they ask for it, don’t use this network.



*       When you finish using the public Wi-fi, always log out from the network, and click “Forget this network” in your settings.



*       Choose your public Wi-fi wisely. Search online to check if it has been verified if you’re not sure.



*       Don’t shop online or do anything private until you switch to a secure connection.

Dear Students,



Hope you are staying healthy and well.    



The World Health Organization(WHO) states that mental health is an integral and essential component of health.  It was estimated worldwide that up to 20% of children and adolescents experience various severity of mental disorders. In order to equip our university community with knowledge and skills to address mental health concerns, we are pleased to deliver a 12-hour Mental Health First Aid course <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmhfa.com.au%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cxlilv%40connect.ust.hk%7Cf14aedc6a7674cacb59d08dde6aded1f%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638920356897246766%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=HXlvkXcgCaEA%2FoCmr6sBZkictpf1r2erCC0pvth8Y%2FE%3D&reserved=0>  to all students and faculty/staff on a regular basis.  In the past decade, over 2,500 students and 700 faculty/staff have completed this course and become Mental Health First Aiders. We highly encourage you to participate in this course if you would like to take part in building a healthier place for the community.  You may find the details of the course below.



Our joint effort is crucial for building a caring, nurturing and stigma-free learning environment.

[The following message is for all NEW students (UG & PG).]



 



 



Dear New Students,



 



Welcome to HKUST! We hope you had a restful summer break. 



 



We write to alert you of a mandatory requirement for all NEW students – the Anti-scam Challenge (ASCM1000). You must complete and “Pass” (50% correct) the challenge by 21 Sep 2025 for continued access to Library resources (all electronic resources and physical access) beyond 21 Sep 2025.



 



ASCM1000 will be accessible via Canvas <https://canvas.ust.hk/> , starting 1 Sep 2025. It contains 15 random multiple-choice questions. This is to equip students with essential information against scams and fraud, a top crime world-wide as technology advances. According to local government statistics, students are often targets of scammers. 



 



If you complete and pass the challenge after the 21 Sep 2025 due date, access to the library may take up to two workdays to resume. For enquiries, please contact the Dean of Students’ Office at antiscam@ust.hk <mailto:antiscam@ust.hk> . 



 



We would also like to share the following from the Hong Kong Government with you: 



*	Message from the Commissioner of Police on Scam Prevention <https://dst.hkust.edu.hk/upload/resources/Message_the_Commissioner_of_Poli.pdf> 

*	HK Anti-Deception Coordination Centre (ADCC) webpage on the latest scam tricks <https://www.adcc.gov.hk/en-hk/alerts.html> 



 



Most importantly, if you are in doubt, seek help. Call ADCC’s helpline at 18222 or email us at antiscam@ust.hk <mailto:antiscam@ust.hk> . Let’s be scam-smart and join hands in supporting each other for a scam-free campus!



 



Regards,



Dean of Students’ Office

The following message is intended for undergraduate students in Fall Term 2025-26



 



 



Dear Undergraduate Students



 



The Fall Term 2025-26 will start on 1 September 2025 (next Monday).  Please check your updated class enrollment records with the SIS (Student Center).  Refer to 'My Class Schedule' for the wait-listing and enrolled classes in both list and weekly calendar views.  You may filter the Enrolled, Waitlisted and Dropped classes in the schedule.



 



Due to system routine maintenance and the release of reserved quotas, the Class Enrollment functions (add/drop/swap and the shopping cart) will be SUSPENDED from 11:59pm, 31 August (Sunday) to 9:30am, 1 September 2025 (Monday).  Students who wish to submit add/drop requests before the start of term are advised to complete their requests by 11:59pm, 31 August.  Checking of “My Class Schedule” will not be affected and is available throughout the term.



 



The last day of Add/Drop period of most undergraduate classes is 13 September 2025 (Saturday).  The add/drop/swap functions will close at 11:59pm on that day.  For the wait-listing classes, a place may be confirmed automatically any time during the add/drop period when vacancies arise.  Please check your class enrollment records frequently.  If you no longer want to enroll in the classes you are waiting, you must DROP the 'waiting' classes yourself.  Around 1:00am each day, email notifications will be sent to students whose waiting class has been confirmed on the previous day.



 



Please be reminded again that classes in your shopping cart are not yet confirmed.  You need to enroll the classes before the end of add/drop if you want to take the classes.



 



Let us know if you have any questions.  Please always quote your student number and full name in your e-mail enquiries.  Thank you.

Dear students,



Welcome to the 2025-26 academic year. It is with great joy that I greet you on this first day of school. This year we are excited to admit a record high of nearly 1,100 new undergraduate students, with around one-third of them coming from an impressive diversity of 29 countries and regions, including new additions from Belarus, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Rwanda, and Yemen. Similarly, we have admitted a record number of over 500 research postgraduate students and 1,600 full-time and part-time MSc students. Thank you for your trust in HKUST as the place to build your future. Together, we live out our motto, “Engineering Our Future!”

 

This year also marks a significant change in our undergraduate admissions process, with a good portion of you being admitted directly into your departments. This department-based admission allows you an early start to follow a tailored pathway specific to your chosen department, while the school-based admission provides you with the flexibility to explore various fields – offering the best of both worlds.

 

To enhance your learning experience, we have established a new leadership position for an Executive Director for Undergraduate Recruitment and Student Development in this academic year. This role is dedicated to strengthening our engagement with industry partners, creating more collaboration and internship opportunities for you. With joining forces of our leadership team of Associate Deans, Center/Program Directors, Department Heads, we are committed to enriching your experience and helping you fulfill your aspirations. 

 

Your university years may be one of the most memorable years of your life or the most critical years for your personal and professional development. As you embark on this journey, I encourage you to explore and grow beyond the classroom. From exchanges to internships, competitions to student organizations, volunteering to leadership training, each of these experiences will enrich your education and help you discover your passions and strengths.

 

As you transition to a new environment and stage of life, it is absolutely normal at times to feel frustrated and lost. Many students experience these feelings, and I want to let you know that you are not alone. Whether it’s reaching out to your friends, connecting with peer mentors, or talking to our dedicated wellness team staff, faculty members, or academic advisors, there are many people here who genuinely care and want to support you. So step out and don’t hesitate to lean on us. We’ll help you navigate this journey and discover yourself.

 

The Engineering Commons – our “home” and vibrant hub has truly become a cornerstone of our community for hosting a number of major events. I encourage you to make the most of the Commons and participate in activities there for socializing, learning and collaborating throughout your years at HKUST.

 

As a key champion in transforming engineering education, we are committed to nurturing your growth. A heartfelt welcome again to each of you. May your time at HKUST be fulfilling and unforgettable! See you around!



Sincerely,

Prof. Hong K. LO

Dean of Engineering

HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP



	



The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) today extended its warmest congratulations to the nation and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) for the exceptional performance in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 2025 Global Innovation Index (GII). The "Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou" cluster has been ranked the 1st largest innovation cluster in the Global Innovation Index 2025 top 100 ranking, ascending from its previous position and marking a historic achievement. This rise to the top is underscored by exceptional performance metrics, with the cluster filing 2,292 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, publishing 3,775 scientific articles, and securing 135 venture capital deals—all per 1 million inhabitants over the past five years. This data reflects the cluster’s unparalleled growth and dynamic capacity for world-leading innovation.



The sustained excellence also underscores the powerful synergy and collaborative spirit within the GBA. The ranking, which this year expanded its criteria to include venture capital activity alongside patent applications and scientific publications, provides a comprehensive validation of the cluster's robust innovation ecosystem. It recognizes not only "quantitative" outputs but also "qualitative" strengths in higher education, international talent attraction, and strong capital market support.



The WIPO GII 2025 event was a significant honor for Hong Kong, marking the first time the city hosted the prestigious Global Innovation Index Science and Technology Cluster Launch. The event featured high-level panel discussions, including one titled "Greater Bay Area’s Innovation Strengths and Future Potential," moderated by HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP, and another titled "Leading Clusters from Other World Regions," moderated by Mr. Marco ALEMAN, Assistant Director General of WIPO.



In her opening address, Prof. Ip stated: "Hong Kong is exceptionally honored and thrilled to host this prestigious event for the first time. It highlights Hong Kong’s significance both as a core city of the Greater Bay Area and as a global innovation and technology hub."



She further emphasized the region's strategic importance: "The Greater Bay Area (GBA) plays a strategically important role in the nation's scientific and technological innovation system, a status clearly evidenced by its performance in the Global Innovation Index. After ranking second globally for five consecutive years, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster has now risen to claim the top position. This achievement underscores the GBA's role as a leading global performer in both innovation and economic impact. I believe this success is driven by its comprehensive innovation ecosystem, which comprises robust R&D capabilities, advanced industries, a large and dynamic market, strategic investments, solid infrastructure, sound government policy and regulation, and ample funding."



The panel of experts then delivered deeper insights into these key drivers, exploring the region’s world-class R&D capabilities, the strategic deployment of “venture capital,” and the dynamic growth of its startup community. Discussions highlighted the essential policies shaping the cluster’s success—including those related to talent attraction, financial incentives, intellectual property protection, and cross-border collaboration. The panel also examined the evolving role of universities in advancing frontier research, facilitating commercialization, and cultivating high-level talent, as well as the growing importance of international partnerships in guiding the cluster’s future development.





HKUST: An Engine of Innovation in the GBA Cluster





As a cornerstone of this top-ranked cluster, HKUST’s contributions are deeply woven into the fabric of the GBA’s innovation ecosystem. The University is a prolific generator of high-impact knowledge, consistently ranked first in the Nature Index for patent influence within China and boasting an exceptionally high patent utilization rate. This strong performance ensures that its research continues to create tangible economic and social value.



HKUST’s culture of innovation has directly nurtured a new generation of industry leaders. Its alumni and faculty are the driving force behind multiple GBA unicorns and tech giants, including global leader DJI, industrial automation powerhouse Googol Tech, Intelligent vision product leader APT Electronics, advanced smart manufacturing innovator SmartMore, a HK listed mobile sports simulation games developer GALA Sports and Zhuhai's rising star Yunzhou Tech.



This entrepreneurial pipeline is powered by the University’s robust support system, which includes four established incubators: InnoBay@CWB in Hong Kong, the Blue Bay Incubator in Shenzhen, the Guangdong-HK-Macau (International) Youth Entrepreneur Hub in Guangzhou, and the HKUST Foshan Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization in Foshan.



These physical hubs are complemented by comprehensive academic programs, including experiential-based learning for undergraduates and the master’s program in Technology Leadership and Entrepreneurship (TLE) under the Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies’ Division of Integrative Systems and Design (ISD). Together, these initiatives are designed to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators, equipping them to work across disciplines and develop disruptive innovations that address pressing societal challenges.



“The GBA’s top ranking is a resounding validation of our collective efforts,” said Prof. Nancy Ip in her concluding remarks. “Since its founding, HKUST has placed strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as an active engine for the innovation ecosystem. We have contributed significantly to the GBA’s growth story through high-impact patents—with a utilization rate of 30%—as well as an unparalleled record of nurturing unicorns, and incubators and ISD programs that empower tomorrow’s entrepreneurs. We will continue to leverage these strengths to solidify the GBA’s role as a leading international innovation hub.”



The University remains dedicated to fostering the cross-disciplinary research and international cooperation necessary to unlock the next chapter of the GBA's innovation story.
