Dear students,



Welcome to the 2025-26 academic year. It is with great joy that I greet you on this first day of school. This year we are excited to admit a record high of nearly 1,100 new undergraduate students, with around one-third of them coming from an impressive diversity of 29 countries and regions, including new additions from Belarus, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Rwanda, and Yemen. Similarly, we have admitted a record number of over 500 research postgraduate students and 1,600 full-time and part-time MSc students. Thank you for your trust in HKUST as the place to build your future. Together, we live out our motto, “Engineering Our Future!”

 

This year also marks a significant change in our undergraduate admissions process, with a good portion of you being admitted directly into your departments. This department-based admission allows you an early start to follow a tailored pathway specific to your chosen department, while the school-based admission provides you with the flexibility to explore various fields – offering the best of both worlds.

 

To enhance your learning experience, we have established a new leadership position for an Executive Director for Undergraduate Recruitment and Student Development in this academic year. This role is dedicated to strengthening our engagement with industry partners, creating more collaboration and internship opportunities for you. With joining forces of our leadership team of Associate Deans, Center/Program Directors, Department Heads, we are committed to enriching your experience and helping you fulfill your aspirations. 

 

Your university years may be one of the most memorable years of your life or the most critical years for your personal and professional development. As you embark on this journey, I encourage you to explore and grow beyond the classroom. From exchanges to internships, competitions to student organizations, volunteering to leadership training, each of these experiences will enrich your education and help you discover your passions and strengths.

 

As you transition to a new environment and stage of life, it is absolutely normal at times to feel frustrated and lost. Many students experience these feelings, and I want to let you know that you are not alone. Whether it’s reaching out to your friends, connecting with peer mentors, or talking to our dedicated wellness team staff, faculty members, or academic advisors, there are many people here who genuinely care and want to support you. So step out and don’t hesitate to lean on us. We’ll help you navigate this journey and discover yourself.

 

The Engineering Commons – our “home” and vibrant hub has truly become a cornerstone of our community for hosting a number of major events. I encourage you to make the most of the Commons and participate in activities there for socializing, learning and collaborating throughout your years at HKUST.

 

As a key champion in transforming engineering education, we are committed to nurturing your growth. A heartfelt welcome again to each of you. May your time at HKUST be fulfilling and unforgettable! See you around!



Sincerely,

Prof. Hong K. LO

Dean of Engineering

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) today extended its warmest congratulations to the nation and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) for the exceptional performance in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 2025 Global Innovation Index (GII). The "Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou" cluster has been ranked the 1st largest innovation cluster in the Global Innovation Index 2025 top 100 ranking, ascending from its previous position and marking a historic achievement. This rise to the top is underscored by exceptional performance metrics, with the cluster filing 2,292 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, publishing 3,775 scientific articles, and securing 135 venture capital deals—all per 1 million inhabitants over the past five years. This data reflects the cluster’s unparalleled growth and dynamic capacity for world-leading innovation.



The sustained excellence also underscores the powerful synergy and collaborative spirit within the GBA. The ranking, which this year expanded its criteria to include venture capital activity alongside patent applications and scientific publications, provides a comprehensive validation of the cluster's robust innovation ecosystem. It recognizes not only "quantitative" outputs but also "qualitative" strengths in higher education, international talent attraction, and strong capital market support.



The WIPO GII 2025 event was a significant honor for Hong Kong, marking the first time the city hosted the prestigious Global Innovation Index Science and Technology Cluster Launch. The event featured high-level panel discussions, including one titled "Greater Bay Area’s Innovation Strengths and Future Potential," moderated by HKUST President Prof. Nancy IP, and another titled "Leading Clusters from Other World Regions," moderated by Mr. Marco ALEMAN, Assistant Director General of WIPO.



In her opening address, Prof. Ip stated: "Hong Kong is exceptionally honored and thrilled to host this prestigious event for the first time. It highlights Hong Kong’s significance both as a core city of the Greater Bay Area and as a global innovation and technology hub."



She further emphasized the region's strategic importance: "The Greater Bay Area (GBA) plays a strategically important role in the nation's scientific and technological innovation system, a status clearly evidenced by its performance in the Global Innovation Index. After ranking second globally for five consecutive years, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster has now risen to claim the top position. This achievement underscores the GBA's role as a leading global performer in both innovation and economic impact. I believe this success is driven by its comprehensive innovation ecosystem, which comprises robust R&D capabilities, advanced industries, a large and dynamic market, strategic investments, solid infrastructure, sound government policy and regulation, and ample funding."



The panel of experts then delivered deeper insights into these key drivers, exploring the region’s world-class R&D capabilities, the strategic deployment of “venture capital,” and the dynamic growth of its startup community. Discussions highlighted the essential policies shaping the cluster’s success—including those related to talent attraction, financial incentives, intellectual property protection, and cross-border collaboration. The panel also examined the evolving role of universities in advancing frontier research, facilitating commercialization, and cultivating high-level talent, as well as the growing importance of international partnerships in guiding the cluster’s future development.





HKUST: An Engine of Innovation in the GBA Cluster





As a cornerstone of this top-ranked cluster, HKUST’s contributions are deeply woven into the fabric of the GBA’s innovation ecosystem. The University is a prolific generator of high-impact knowledge, consistently ranked first in the Nature Index for patent influence within China and boasting an exceptionally high patent utilization rate. This strong performance ensures that its research continues to create tangible economic and social value.



HKUST’s culture of innovation has directly nurtured a new generation of industry leaders. Its alumni and faculty are the driving force behind multiple GBA unicorns and tech giants, including global leader DJI, industrial automation powerhouse Googol Tech, Intelligent vision product leader APT Electronics, advanced smart manufacturing innovator SmartMore, a HK listed mobile sports simulation games developer GALA Sports and Zhuhai's rising star Yunzhou Tech.



This entrepreneurial pipeline is powered by the University’s robust support system, which includes four established incubators: InnoBay@CWB in Hong Kong, the Blue Bay Incubator in Shenzhen, the Guangdong-HK-Macau (International) Youth Entrepreneur Hub in Guangzhou, and the HKUST Foshan Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization in Foshan.



These physical hubs are complemented by comprehensive academic programs, including experiential-based learning for undergraduates and the master’s program in Technology Leadership and Entrepreneurship (TLE) under the Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies’ Division of Integrative Systems and Design (ISD). Together, these initiatives are designed to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators, equipping them to work across disciplines and develop disruptive innovations that address pressing societal challenges.



“The GBA’s top ranking is a resounding validation of our collective efforts,” said Prof. Nancy Ip in her concluding remarks. “Since its founding, HKUST has placed strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as an active engine for the innovation ecosystem. We have contributed significantly to the GBA’s growth story through high-impact patents—with a utilization rate of 30%—as well as an unparalleled record of nurturing unicorns, and incubators and ISD programs that empower tomorrow’s entrepreneurs. We will continue to leverage these strengths to solidify the GBA’s role as a leading international innovation hub.”



The University remains dedicated to fostering the cross-disciplinary research and international cooperation necessary to unlock the next chapter of the GBA's innovation story.
